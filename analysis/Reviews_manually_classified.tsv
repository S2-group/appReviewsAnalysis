Need to access overseas streaming services, get this. I love this VPN, it's blooming fast, sips lightly at system resources and its free. There are ads here, but so far I have only seen them even actually in the app, haven't had any pop-ups or anything like that.

Opening cards on my Moto 360 toggles sunlight mode (provided you're on Wear 5.x, which all current AW watches have available) so that the display is at max brightness for a few seconds and has the best chance of scanning correctly.

This is by no means an income just extra $. The apps permissions are legitimate and reasonable. You need to be at site to do assignment & camera to take pictures usually required for job.

Bad UI/UX, full of ads, keep crashing, required extra permissions that's not necessary. Not friendly with Android 6+. Loved this app. Clean design, very responsive. Easy to use. No bug so far I find. I paid the full version already before the trial expired. :D BTW, It works with OTG where the ES wasn't supported on my HTC 10. Great!	-	TMP

(And it doesn't need any spec permission which is a big-big plus!) The only annoying thing is when I manually set a detail of a food, I can't type directly the numbers, and let's say for a 500 gram food it takes time with the slider.. (Even if I had saved a new one into my favourites with exact grams and calories, it seems like it keeps only the ratio, and I have to reenter the amount of grams.)

Your email is also synchronized/indexed on the servers to provide the search functionality.  Even though this might provide additional functionality that the IMAP, SMTP and other servers don't provide out of the box, this is also a major security and privacy concern.

Today I came across one comment from staff in the reviews saying that the app should have permission to access the contacts. I did that and it worked! I like this app for customizing my watch face and if they fix the issue for nexus 6p it deserves 5 star.	-	PRB, FU

On my Nexus 10 with omnirom marshmellow it doesn't appear to find my location, even though permissions granted and high accuracy switched on. The menu just says 'allow location access...' whereas the Nexus 5 shows the co-ordinates once its found them.  That said, the Nexus 10 has switched to night time mode at sunset....	-	PRB

Secondly, a spell check would be superb. Many thanks and keep up the good work.  --Update 26/01/2017-- For some reason new files and folders are no longer visible when I try and view the Writer Folder contents on my PC. Perhaps some permission setting has changed somewhere. Old files and folders are visible and I can see all the files on my phone using File Commander.

One annoying problem it has is that deleting tickets from the app doesn'delete them from the phone, and they get reloaded when you look for new tickets. The UI of the ticket back is cramped and makes misclicks easy. Permissions are a bit overboard.	-	TMP

Can't send pics from my messenger installed in knox as it always says no media found. If i install separate messenger app from play store its working and i can send pics from there but i want to have messenger installed in knox app only and i have uninstalled messenger app which was installed from play store just for pattern locking.

It even closes if I press the home button.   The one huge negative caveat is that if I have this browser open and leave my phone without closing the app or pressing power / sleep button the phone will not go into sleep mode.  The phone and the inbrowser will stay open indefinitely.   Phone won't go into sleep mode and browser won't close if phone is left unattended.	+	PP

That may be ok with someone else but i dont like having to download yet another app that needs permissions to make account that is is needed for this free app work. I dont even know if the 2nd necessary app is free? Dont care either, it could be a complex way to skew reviews, in fact i cant think of a good reason why so much overhead is needed for such a simple idea. And a account? For my child to log chores? Seriously.... not for me."	-	NR

You will notice that the LED will be turned off.

This is not how the new permission model is supposed to run. Apps should still function with limited permissions.  And no, you don't require my device's location for playing music from my phone.
