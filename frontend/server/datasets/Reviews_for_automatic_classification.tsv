It's the main reason i use Visual Voicemail. However, a super helpful function, for me, would be a box to mark as \save to contacts\ for each voicemail coming from a new number. I would gladly approve any new permissions necessary to make that happen so I don't have to go back and forth between Contacts and Visual Voicemail.

Allowing access to SMS and managing phone calls are all \I\ need. So if I want to have sms read to me I have to give access to \all files and photos\. It's shady that sms, files, and photos are bundled into one permission. Again If you don't \allow\  all permissions you can't use this application.

While everyone is different and therefore will have a slightly varying opinion, you would have to be either mad, jealous or simply stupid not to love this app and service.  As far as I'm concerned, MEGA sets the standard for the cloud storage solution, as well as user care and privacy, I might add. In the years since I started using MEGA, I haven't felt my privacy was threatened in any way. Au contraire! Their cloud servers are the only systems besides my own that I feel comfortable storing my data on without a GPG run first lol!  And what other so-called *drive or *box service gives you a whopping 50GB free and a very marginal fee for a googolplex more! x) In short, I'd recommend MEGA to everyone I know. New Zealand should be proud to be the home of such a privacy-aware and outstanding company.

They have secure VPN servers all around the world that you can pick from. With unlimited bandwidth usage, no logs (this has been proven in court) and they offer SOCKS5 proxies for less than $40/year.  It's a no-brainer deal when it comes to your security and privacy. Think about how much you pay for internet service per year!  Plus PIA has great support and their apps are easy to use and they also offer more advanced setups for OpenVPN/OpenWRT.

Not even HARD resetting both watch & phone fixed my issues. After Asus saw my 5 star rating downgraded to 1 star, I received instructions to manually enable all the necessary permissions to allow the app to function fully on 6.0. Now I can customize my watch faces again. I wish the app would've properly requested necessary permissions though like all my other apps on 6.0 have done.

I've had results that were totally irrelevant. Hence that app defeats it's main purpose. Against my better judgement I'm going back to Google.

It may be a good app, I  don't know, but it harvests your information and passes it on to others.

It successfully opened the QR Code I needed to link to my Google Authenticator, too. Perfect.

I tried everything and still does not work, even worse, a friend of mine downloaded the app in his iphone and he can track my device any time without having given him any special code, which i think is a big privacy issue.

Your justification and speculation is drawn directly from you lr lack of knowledge and interlect in regards to software development. Make u own a smartphone ur privacy has been exploited long time ago. Lol. Listen straight up it's decent app yeah, I just can't stand it when people run developers into ground.

Most annoying thing abt this application is the permanent icon. Seriously, there is a reason why all other apps out there does not have such an icon.  Atleast it should be optional. Another annoying thing is the fact that it asks permission for location everytime you open it... Why can't it just ask for permission just once  like  rest of the apps? Also it shouldn't display the ad to install itself... The UX definitely needs improvement...

After double checking, I've realized that the app does many things, some of which require the permissions requested. My apologies to the author, I've since changed my rating to a 4 as to not upset the current rating. I however have not tried the software.  Original comments for archive: This app requires access to things it has no business accessing, do not trust apps of this sort. Author needs to be realistic, or get bent.

Asus' app doesn't even have ads. The widget works, is fast and doesn't open the main app. An auto-off funktion is included. This one's my new favourite.

Then, when you get to the \Let's Hook Up\ screen, swipe from right to left and it should show up.  With that said, I shouldn't have to have Location turned on for this to work.  Intrusive.

I would like to see negative rewards in addition to the manual negative points, or the weekly expectations amount. This app does great getting kids excited to do chores, but bad behaviors have no consequences in the system. Older kids swear, younger kids lie, fighting or using electronics without permission are some things that could be a common, recurring negative reward. - 10 pts for this = 10 min of chores to make it up... Etc.

It's my new favourite file explorer app, after uninstalling es file manager after it started notifying me of things I hadn't asked it to do.

For improvement, I hope the app will allow customizing the theme more freely, and will support realtime stock quote in HK Stock Market.

It is so nice to have access to such great widgets with weather data and other services, and the widgets themselves are clean and simple. I would give this 5 stars, but there have a been a few issues with the widget responding weirdly when the location permission is denied. It's easy enough to work around, but the UI isn't very friendly with permissions. A better explanation of permission use within the app would be worth 5 stars

Thumbs down to AT&T and Fullscreen.  I expect the replybot will tag this review, so I will repond in advance. It is a LIE that disabled apps don't use memory.  They don't run, but they still use up storage space that could hold other apps or useful content.                              Also it has in-app purchase enabled and I could not decline that permission. Borders on fraud in my opinion.

But inefficient if compared to Ola... Features like ride later. To schedule a ride in advance is missing... Secondly users have to install Uber App on phone&can't be shifted to sd card.which is not a mandatory in Ola.  Which is non preferable by many users... So finally Ola is much more flexible.... And better choice in terms of privacy....... Eventually for me... Ola wins the race.... And one more point.... Where is the customer care....??? No contact numbers for any contact center

The only weird thing about this watch face is you have to go into your app permissions and allow it to use your information before it actually appears in your watch or phone.

Webm playback is god-awful unfortunately, and I was unable to find a way to change permissions to allow image/video saving without resetting the app.

But there's annoyances like after opening the left menu, hitting the back button logs you out. I can't count how many times I've done that. And I don't want notifications, so I hit deny when asked to grant permissions, but it asks every time.  Just save my choice please. Checking order history always comes up blank too. So OK for a quick update, but don't expect a lot.

It will just cut all Internet traffic as soon as you switch to a different network or lose connection (which, being a mobile app, it should be able to cope with). The only way to get connection back is to manually close the app,restart it and then \ok\ the permissions. It's been a good app until this version so hopefully they'll fix it soon.

I'm a contractor who builds decks and fences and Angie's List has asked me to get my customers to sign up for memberships with Angie's List which is kind of pointless because I'm already there contractor. I lost four good contracts because of Angie's List. Once my customers give Angie's List their credit card number to sign up for a $50 membership per year Angie's List continues to charge the customers credit card every single year for a $50 membership even though they didn't sign up for a second or third membership. Angie's List also refuses to stop charging my customers credit cards unless my customers take time out of their day to write a written request Angie's List to stop charging their credit cards every single year for a new membership they did not request. Angie's List has affected my business reputation. I have received negative reviews on several websites from good customers who are extremely pissed off that Angie's List charge their credit card without their permission because I referred them to Angie's List. I tried to install the Angie's List at because I heard things have changed however after reading the reviews I can see things have only gotten worse. I already have an Angie's List profile that clearly explains this problem with Angie's List Right on the front page however Angie's List closed my profile to keep consumers from being aware of the scam. When I install the app and tried to search my profile Angie's List hit my profile from the search results so nobody can find my business now simply because I wrote on my front page a complaint about my customers being upset about the charges they did not authorize. Angie's List solution is to not resolve the scam but rather covered up by keeping consumers from being able to see my business page listing on the Angie's List website and app service. Do not use Angie's List they are complete scam and try to cover up their own scams

I have contacted the developer, and they have said is required to verify premium purchase. However since other apps do not require the same permission in order to verify in app purchases, the conclusion is that the app is either collecting personsl information or the developer does not know how to handle permissions.

That was OK with one computer in the house.  With more than one computer and mobile devices, and the need to have more varied and random passwords to keep your privacy, Lastpass is an essential tool.  My online activities would be insecure or very slow without it. I have used LastPass for over 2 years, and it has continued to improve.

But the only problem is when I send a message even if I don't have a load it will sent because there's no sign of (!) but I can't recieve the text. Please fix it. And I suggest that you have to add more improvements like in appearance to edit what they want for example in bubbles if they want to change the color or something like that, I suggest also to have private box for the privacy and have a color emoji like in Iphone it will pretty much to look. If this are all will apply in your app I will rate 5 stars and I think others will loved it too.

I'm a little annoyed that my Nexus 6P asks me to enable Smart Lock every time I connect to my 2016 VW GTI with the MIB II.  It also likes to ask me to grant my car permission to view text messages every time the phone is connected, even though i grant that permission every time.  Initially I thought it to be a Bluetooth issue, but have since noticed that it most frequently coincides with connecting or disconnecting Android Auto.

And just when you think you are getting to places where you want to look at (because it shows you jobs by area,  not availability), it resets and you have to start all over.  Plus,  I see no reason to give this app access to my pics and phone information. It wants too much of your privacy for no reason.

You can't swipe them away or x them out. They stay there until you click on them and then they automatically start downloading a new keyboard design. You can delete it once it's done downloading but that's not the point. No app should be allowed to download extra stuff to my phone without my permission.

Go to settings, go to apps, go to this app , tap on permissions and give it permission to use your camera. 😉  unfortunately my ceiling has an odd rectangular patch in it, and I am trying to find out if there is something there. Maybe I have too much time on my hands.. maybe I've watched too many movies and have high hopes for their being a few million dollars up there.. 😛 But if you saw it, you would think it looks pretty suspicious.😨😰😱😁

It just says that I need to sign in, so I tap okay and it says that it needs permission.  I tap okay, again, andddd nothing.  It doesn't sign in to anything and the not able to watch problem still occurs.  I've tried this neverending cycle a dozen times now and still nothing.  Maybe you should just not make it maditory to sign in, like it is for desktop.

But Facebook's messenger got out of control, so I had to look for alternatives again. Right now it seems more like an SNS specialised browser than an app. The Facebook page gave me a warning that in the future, messages might only be readable on the messenger, so if that could be implemented separately (with notifications), all my needs would be fulfilled.

The app should check if the device in use as a proximity sensor, and if it doesn't, it should alert the user that his device is not compatible. Better yet, declare in the app manifest file the use of the feature \proximity sensor\ (this way, the user won't be able to install the app at all, but it will prevent possible crashes). Other than that, I love the use of material design. It also works great on marshmallow, as it asks for the necessary permissions. Keep up the great work!

I didn't download this app!\   Verizon, if you are going to add an app, notify users first.  Don't just automatically add an app to users' phones without their permission.  This is not an app for me!  I don't need this!  I disabled it in the systems apps. It's labeled 'Business Volte'.

The app persistently fails to connect reporting \Wrong username/password\... strange that my usernames/passwords do work when connecting via  PC/Internet.  It has (a few times at least) connected via WiFi but only shows the sample files and NOT any of the files I have placed in the public folders!  Totally unimpressed so far!  Up Date...  Thanks for the reply. 'Yes' remote access was fully enabled, however Remote Access proved impossible over the Internet with my mobile device (Galaxy S5 - O2 sp). Not that it matters now as I've returned the Seagate Personal Cloud as \Unfit for purpose\ as it is impossible to customise folder permissions, thus anyone with any access has full permission to read/write/delete. I've replaced it with a Synology DS.

Using BlackBerry PRIV and fully functional. Needed to uninstall the app and then reinstall in order for the app to reacquire permissions. Equalizer works, remote on / off works also.  These features did not work initially.

I returned to AOL & found its technology comparable to mainstream browsers & email. And if you like, you can get all ur email accts in 1 place. Very user friendly & yes, the verbal \YOU GOT MAIL\ notifier is same from day 1.  Only downside, needs looking into \the acct signs out 2-3 times a day, having to sign back in\ plz advise if this is a default safety feature.

It feels invasive when things happen without my permission. 2nd, I don't like having to login. 3rd, when studying vocabulary, I think the Usage section should be placed somewhere at the top, perhaps after the Meaning section. Also, at least put the vocab word in italics so we can easily notice it when reading the sentence. 4th, I'd like to see some idioms, interjections & prepositions added to this app.

However, the app has some problems with load times, and the inability to filter by pet friendly (on web too). There are occasional random bugs in the app, but nothing was a show stopper and the service is worth a few annoyances. Also: release notes say minor bug fixes but they are requesting new permissions for contacts and SMS .

However, the camera quality is absolute crap. Also, privacy should be improved so you don't get caught exposed in anyway while you're checking your friend requests. People can just join your room whenever they want to.

The actual real numbers on your phone remain the same. All that these kind of apps do is just kindly ask your permission to enter your system and collect information and nothing else. Do the math and you'll see, good luck folk's.

Making us disclose our location to turn on a speaker is shameless information harvesting. Audio is still delayed when watching video content. Please fix this or let us roll back to a previous version. All software and firmware are up-to-date.

I don't want to have an account with lifx just to operate my light bulbs. Why do I need to send data to an lifx server before I turn lights on or off in my own home? I'd be fine with authenticating with the light bulb. Pressing a button on the bulb to put it in \pairing\ mode, and moving on from there is all I should need to do. Then the app demands my location before even allowing me to connect to my bulb. Why? Why does lifx need to know who I am, and where I am, before allowing me to turn my lights on and off? What's next: will the next version need access to my contacts before allowing me to turn on my light and read a book? It's ridiculous.  The system is also very buggy. State management issues cause labels in the GUI to be incorrect. Lights randomly disconnect and need to be physically turned off and back on before I can see them again in the app. This can be really disconcerting if I've set a color that is overwhelmingly annoying and I lose control over the light. I've never had to reboot a light bulb before. :-/  The bugs will be taken care of. If not, there are other apps that allow me to control my lifx bulbs. But the privacy issues disgust me.

Also you cannot use the app at all without accepting these permissions which is ridiculous. I would expect to at least be able to use it as a simple remote. You should be asking for permissions when I actually go to use the feature not as soon as I open the app (as per Google's own permission guidelines).

Going through the reviews here, (with due respect to all), my thoughts - I am not affiliated with this app: 1.  Depending on phones and their age etc, if you get wrong skewed data, calibrate for the app. Use with proper finger placement. It's a quite good app.  2. What \burns\ your finger is the camera flash. Use in a darker place and not press so hard. 3. In certain locations, this would be great for informal health care. Some places or situations can only afford informal healthcare.  4. Calibrate with reference to mainstream equipment and this could be your best daily checkup. 5. For those concerned about privacy, google etc probably knows more about you than you can remember. Such apps actually help further development in the world of medical equipment etc. 6. Explore the app, there are a lot of extras in even the free version. Did you find the pedometer etc yet? So many suggested simple exercises are good. Better to move a bit than not at all. 7. Thank you to the developers 🙏

Edit after developer answer: there are no options like that. I have the free version. Edit 2: Developer response: hi - its in your device Settings & Location (Sometimes under Privacy and safety), and under Location methods turn on GPS. Also, please be sure that you have your information filled out in the app's Profile screen so the app can calculate calories  Me: But the problem is that there is no \Location\ in settings or in Privacy and safety. I wish I could send you picture. My GPS is on. Also Profile is made and info is there. Settings only have these: Sounds, instructions, coach voice, halfway point, motivate me, distance units and restore previous purchases. Any info how to get it to work? Without distance this app is worthless to me.

And amongst the Facebook permissions that can not be unchecked is photos and list of friends. Yes, this is even before you have begun browsing the posts. This is a complete and shameful rape of privacy, something we would never accept in the real world. I am a customer and would like to be seen as a human with dignity. My first impression of this app even before using it is that they do not see me as such.

It seems to assume by default that I want my voice recorded while it takes my ECG reading, which is not the case at all.  (While I understand how voice annotations might be useful for research, I do not want to participate, and I really dislike that this kind of very sensitive feature is \opt out\ rather than \opt in\.)  Similarly the app wants my geo location without telling me what it's going to do with that information or how it's even related to the task at hand.  It then asks for permission to use \vital signs sensors\ on my phone without explaining what that means or why the ECG device itself is not sufficient for that.   Separately from that, I was eager to integrate with my Google Fit account, but it grays out the screen and freezes when I try to set that up.    At least the old functionality still works now that I'm past the gauntlet of data requests, so I'm still happy enough with this app.

It also unnecessarily asks that I sign in again every time I want to see my driving history (\taking security seriously\ doesn't justify this—even gmail doesn't ask for my password every time I open my email). It also requests Phone permission unnecessarily (for \troubleshooting and analytics\?), but you can turn that off in settings.

So my summary is that it doesn't work and requires too many permissions(highly suspect)

A coupon clipping app does NOT need access to Bluetooth settings, contacts, network information, my cell number or my call log. Ridiculous. Get this fixed or upgrade to API23 settings. As it currently stands, this app looks dangerously like spyware.

For anyone who has a newer phone, you have to \allow\ the app to access your camera and storage. For some reason it doesn't prompt as it should.

The only gripe I have so far is that contact information is blocked by the privacy setting, which cannot be changed in the Android app. I feel like the Admin of the schedule should be able to display information for all employees as a group setting. We also use this service as a call list, so having to walk each employee though disabling their privacy setting is a pain.

Only u have admin access that doesn't mean u can completely block persons privacy.  Pls recover update & allow users to update calendar entry ad it was in last update. its serious issue. Otherwise we as employees will  force our management to change to other mail accessing Apps which are far better that this. Pls reply with update or some immediate solution.

Last week, I had chatted with a Norton rep and was told that if you need to get a new phone within the year of your subscription, you lose the $29.99 you paid and you have to pay another $29.99 to use Norton WIFI on your new phone. Today I got a call from a Norton representative explaining that we WILL be able to deactivate the service from one phone and activate it on a new phone without having to pay another $29.99. He said Norton is in the process of making this possible (this better be true!) So far, the Norton WiFi Privacy app has worked great on my Nexus 6.

The app does everything it's supposed to. If your corporation isn't requiring it then don't install. If it is required then your company may need to check its policies on personally owned devices and privacy. If you're having trouble encrypting your device via the app, try it from within Android under Settings. Bet it won't work there either and that's not the app's fault.

No built-in app should require permission to \record your conversations without your knowledge!\ And when you try to disable it tells you \basic functions of your phone might not work.\ I disabled it anyway. No problems so far. FU Samsung!

And it works almost perfectly. The battery usage is a tad high, but definitely not a deal breaker. You also have to pause/unpause or restart the VPN when switching from WiFi to mobile data to continue browsing. This effect is leased by the inclusion of a pause button in the pinned push notification from the app. Going from WiFi to data to WiFi seems to work fine. Overall, a great app and a great service. Privacy has never been easier.

This application consistently has competitive rates, makes it extremely simple to turn the currency both directions.

I find out that they just charged my credit card and restarted the subscription without my permission. On top of that they removed the ability to cancel from the app and make you jump through hoops to do so and you can't remove your credit card.

No you can't access all my files (which I get for media display). And why the hell does this need to access my phone to make calls etc?

No matter howoften I grant this app permission to do so, it just won't take. X-plorer and other File Managers handle this just fine, but T-CMD fails all the way :-(Update: Had to retract one star, because now it keeps asking for external SD write permission, over and over again. Have to click on Cancel to finish the write - very annoying. *********** Better than FileExpert, better than Astro FM and then some. One request, update those antiquated icons, plz.

It says SD card must be encrypted every 15 minutes  (and it was already encrypted). Then it says SD card cannot be encrypted because the encryption permission must be allowed  (and the SD card was just encrypted 10 min ago). Then I stopped respondibg to SD card warnings, and now it says the de ice itself must be encrypted (and it was also encrypted all along). POS software - half baked out of development. Also, customer support is nonexistent.

Congratulations!   I do, however, have a few issues with my Beme (maybe my device?) that I would like to point out:  1.  99.9% of the videos I watch are totally fast-forwarded!  The only ones that aren't, are my own videos.  So technically I can't do much on Beme at the moment since the audio of every video I watch is totally incomprehensible.   2.  Settings: I feel like it's lacking general settings.  Maybe a few wifi/data usage-settings and camera quality options,. Also privacy options! 3. LOCATION SETTINGS: This I feel should be one of the top things to customize. I don't think one would always like to share one's exact location details - maybe only add the country, or alternatively have an option to totally make one's location private.  4 Tutorial. The current tutorial is lacking detail. I feel like that a tutorial should be something that totally enhances your confidence with the app - not just showing you one feature.  Maybe include a POV of someone opening the app for the first time. Then carefully running through details such as: taking videos, looping videos, looping reactions, changing settings etc.

Make the login ID & password auto-fill/save or make it so the app automatically signs in when I open the app. It's extremely annoying to have to enter the password every time I open the app, especially when my smartphone is already password protected so a privacy breach is not a concern. @devs: Do you even use your own app? If you did, it would be more user-friendly and intuitive.  2. Put HRA deductible info in plain view w/coverage info, not hidden under the \View Trackers.\ Also needs to load faster.

Seeks permissions that don't seem necessary. Got to check it out more.  Also - compared to ALDIs app - this app is 3 TIMES as much memory.(50meg vs 15 meg).  Wegmans has superb reputation - this bothers me a bit.  It's couponing is great!

You could try to tap into health and dieting apps which have millions of products and barcodes on their databases. I'd happily give you permission to check everything I ever bought and scanned, as MyFitnessPal (for example, and probably all similar apps) store this information on the phone. In this way, I wouldn't have to scan every single product into Boycott. Instead, you'd tell me which of the foods that I bought in the last 3 years violate my criteria.

If you unlock the bootloader it may detect that on some devices and not work. Google was forced to step up security if it wanted the banks to truly get on board. The difference with the old wallet app was they didn't need bank permission and thus didn't give you points or rewards.  It wasn't getting true permission to work. Don't down vote because you hacked your phone.

This app (and the Dunkin Donuts app too) have permission to Bluetooth and use it in some way which causes the Galaxy devices to experience wifi issues when both wifi and Bluetooth are enabled together on the phone. There are pages of forum posts dedicated to this issue and so far SuperCuts and Dunkin Donuts are the two confirmed apps which cause the issue.

The app doesn't have serving sizes but works on the grams/ounces of the items you eat. The app is loaded with every day foods for you to pick from or you can enter your own foods. The number one thing I like about this app is that it doesn't ask for any permissions, which is rare and honest from the developer. However I just found the app not to my tastes and after using it for a few days I removed it. Maybe I'll check back and see how much progress the developer has made before I decide to use it again, but for some people this app is going to be perfect and for others it won't be. I wish the developer the best but the maximum I can give is (2.5) stars but since Google Store doesn't give half points I'll round up to (3). In closing, I recommend to the developer to avoid comments that come across as a whiner. It seems those who gives a low rating and leave a less than favorable review gets berated.

Recipes are poor. It doesn't take in to consideration that you work 9-5 in corporates as need some easy recipes to carry. Some recipes are easy. I was surprised to see that my money was deducted on second month. Before renewing second month, you should seek consent and approval or make it VERY CLEAR during while singing up that this will be renewed every month. Not happy. Lucky that I didn't buy bigger subscription.

But this only works if all family members have the app running. If someone forgets to turn it on, it won't track.

I just did.  Shouldn't the primary caregiver have to grant permission first before any other person gets access to any gizmo? What if strangers somehow get the number and submit themselves as \caregivers \? The primary should receive notification of others trying to gain access to the gizmo and accept or reject and block requests. I want better security!

You get complete stats and box scores. In addition, you get video clips and recaps of the games. Trust me, if you open your mind, you'll love it too.  Check it out right now. What are you waiting for, my permission?

We love it! Love the GPS, the quick answer is great and it has  just enough options for messaging. I wish that there was an auxiliary out for  headphones so there could be privacy on occasion rather than always speakerphone and the step counter counts even when we're driving in the car. Ultimately the perfect alternative to a phone.    (FYI you can have more than one caregiver they just have to download the Gizmo app as well)

Even with the HTC One M8's speakers. Still cool though. I'm always impressed by zero permission apps without ads and IAPs. If using it for other things, then it's awesome.

It is understood why companies and developers need SOME of their permissions and account info, but this seems excessive. If you only want to be able to record a given color in the field to make sure it is accurate, say in an edited photo, something simpler without all the red tape may serve you better. Dont forget to calibrate your device camera to make sure it is spot-on.

This is the first free app I can honestly say I would be happy to pay for.   While the app store is awash with OCR apps that scan to PDF very few produce text files and even less can carry out character recognition close to this app.   My only concern is with some of the app permissions requested such as Full Network Access. Even if OCR was performed remotely I don't see why FNA is required.   Bottom line? The best of the best!

Defeats the purpose of the app entirely. Obviously made by someone who doesn't have children.

Been threatening to shut down Intellicast for some time now, but didn't. Until now. See 100,000 have downloaded STORM, so my guess is STORM sucks. Will keep an open mind, certainly will give credit if STORM is indeed good, but seems just Dumbass corp bs. UPDATE: Installed STORM. UNINSTALLED! Pitiful. Nothing even closer to features offered by Intellicast, and I wasn't a huge fan of it. For those who claim this is a great app, you must have low expectations. Compared to Intellicast, this sucks like a tornado. With News apps, I've find it better to just use a browser. Best part of this approach is you don't have to grant ridiculous permissions just to view publicly accessible information. Got to go...AND WON'T BE BACK...

My phone only locks when turned on , or woke up from sleep mode. This app allows me to lock everything else. My phone is constantly open now , because I know my personal data is secured by this app. Even if someone tries to uninstall this app to gain access it won't let them. You need your password to uninstall it. So If you want stricter privacy on your phone here it is. Great App. No bugs or problems.💯💯💯✔✔✔ 😁👍📵🙋📲✅✅✅💯💯💯

When you go back into the list it puts you right back at the beginning versus the spot where you left off. I also notice that garments are repeated numerous times within the same list so you see the same thing over and over again. At its worst the app placed a $300 order without my consent and has no feature that allows you to cancel it if it has made an error. Be careful using this app!!!!

Once the app is open it has similar functions to the uber app but the map is kind of messy and difficult to view if it's covered in large cartoonish cars. Entering personal info and SMS confirmation seems to work just fine, hopefully they are using encryption and other security measures that are standard but hard to say.

Are you serious?  What about actually fixing the broken things everyone is complaining about before adding more useless features, requiring more permissions?  Also, some store systems aren't working - three weeks in a row in January and not one time was the system able to use the rewards card to get the free/discounted item and it wasn't able to register the purchases for future rewards.  It's past time to fix your IT and/or store support department(s)!

I just wanted a simple app to check the accuracy of my car's speedometer.  I was suspicious when this app initially after installing wants permission to do something to ALL my apps and I couldn't use my back button to undo this.  Then I try it out and within a few minutes my entire screen is a popup enticing me to install Yelp which you should NEVER DO because it could be Trojan malware!  Immediately I uninstalled this spamware app and discovered so many of my app default permission were erased including my home screen button had to be reassigned!  WTH!!

It says in order to give the app permission to access media files, I need to disable my screen overlays in the android settings.

Screen overlay was already off and I couldn't get the app to work. It turns out that an app I use to filter the screen's blue light needed to be temporarily turned off to finish setup. FedEx app installed and works fine now. Only four stars because I prefer the previous blue background to the current all white one.

In theory, the UI is actually ok beyond a certain point. But the amount of permissions that you're forced to accept in order to even start the app is a joke. Since the app is the only way of checking your order status, I only install it when I'm waiting for a delivery and then delete it again once the food arrives. However, in order to even login the first time you install it, you need to do a superfluous address search. The app does some stuff right but generally it's an absolute mess that seems targeted more around what the company can get from the customer, rather than what the customer can gain from using the service. That's never a good sign.

Listed under photos/media/files it states \Modify or DELETE THE contents of your SD card\ Listed under identity \ADD or REMOVE accounts\. Now please, by all means, tell me again about how you can't and don't have the capability to modify or delete the contents of a device? Because that seems pretty cut and dry to me.

Also the controls suck, i wish that u change the controls. I wish that u should tilt instead of using arrows and swip ur finger across the screen to do flips. Also to make it more intense, add nitro like little blue spheres and make a bar and tap on the right to use nitro and left to brake. Also that u had weapons lik missiles to slow down the other players and stun them. And had special power ups and when u swiped ur finger across the screen for a trick if u land right it gives u a boost.

(Which I did) even though it was already on. But even after I did that it said I need to take the \Screen overlay\ off (Whatever that is) and it directed me to all my apps and wanted me to change them all for just this one app. Ive never had to go through all of this for any of my apps. Very disappointed. Was looking forward to finding some new trails.

It's tiny and they even explain the \odd\ permissions requested (unlike most apps that request way too many and are apparently trying to hide their reasons for requesting them instead of outright lying about their need.)

Some say it invades your privacy. It does not. The only reason that permission is there is so you can invite people and share your successes. Others say it has a sync issue. The portfolio arrow, and market arrow mean different things. Portfolio is if you've made money, market is if the stock is up. Great app, being squandered by ignorant reviews.

So, I tested it out on a barely-used tablet beforehand. Happily, it proved even more engaging and replayable than the game that I was used to! Cheers and all the best in 2017! :)

My requests for future enhancements that I feel are critical:  -Ability to remotely power on the GizmoGadget if someone turns it off for sinister reasons (self explanatory I hope) -Ability to send and receive text messages using the Text Messaging app in Android rather than through the GizmoHub App alone. My family is forced to download this app to their phones in order to communicate with my daughter. Therefore, they get ALL the notifications they don't need and ability to change ALL the settings on the device. -Ability to specify which notifications to receive through the GizmoHub, for example, everyone that has the app installed to communicate with my daughter does not need to keep getting notified each time her device is fully charged. -Ability to set permissions to each user that has the app installed. For example, some contacts designated as caregivers (in order to text), do not need to have access to change ALL settings in the GizmoGadget.  **Several of these would be non-issues if the device could text through regular text messaging**

How would it not be better to simply have them on their site or have a document you open to print. There is something seriously wrong with having to give over control of printer through a file download. In this day that pushes trust beyond limits.

I was talking about the color choices on the mini. And seek buttons on tablet mode. And I see you put them all on to the next update. I also got a question: why we can't make a search engine as default? It's because when I open your browser, there is always Google search is default. And I can't change it. I don't use any of the Google products, becouse of some privacy reasons, that's why I prefer you. Also why don't you make a developer version as the pc one? Anyway, thank you!

It downloads pictures without consent and wouldn't allow me to choose not to have it done. Well actually it did, but when I left the page and went back it reset itself to automatic. I only downloaded this to see something someone else had sent me but it wouldn't even let me get as far as choosing that person on my contacts. Very frustrating app. Not worth the effort at all.

Not one of these permissions is relevant to your service. The service is good, but the app is spyware.  EDIT: The latest update now wants the camera too. No other travel app needs all these permissions or social bullshit. You just add the people you travel with.

Needing to scrape up all of my contacts is disgusting.  [Edit] As mentioned below, there are reasons for all of the permissions, and if you read the linked page,  you can see that they are all reasonable. I have no specific reason to believe that they DO scrape my contacts, but also have no evidence that they don't. So you be the judge.  My 1-star rating still remains. It should be a plain web-site, and the extras that are added should be an optional app. I just want to know my wait time and place in line after all, and forcing the app seems like a battering ram designed to break though privacy barriers.

Plus you can't see your past weights through the app, to see them you have to sift through a bunch of emails. And the answer from support is to take a screenshot because data stored on the cloud via app could pose a privacy issue. Lazy bunches who don't want to integrate those functions.  I expected more.

Their new structure wastes data and invades privacy! Ur forced to scan entire receipts to prove purchase, steal private info to sell. Times their rewards by 10 so its 5000 points now for a tiny pack of diapers. Yet I buy diapers I used to get 75 points for and get 160. Barely double the points earned when their joke of rewards are times ten...? They promised new \better\ rewards? They have less than before, they're more dumb, cost 30,000 points for a $5 toy!!! I'm switching!

There's what looks like a map of other users and who they're voting for. In order to launch it they want to collect personal info for data mining purposes. Even that wasn't thought out very well. (LOL you can claim to be a 1yr old baby.) The permission to access location had no confirmation button and the text overhang the edges of the screen. (No I wasn't zoomed. My screen has a distinct orange outline if zoomed.) I had to crash out to get it.

My favorite thing is it doesn't have any unnecessary permissions.

Frightened noob responses - not necessary. Just keep your stuff safe, the Tech is for your convenience. Understand it. Look closely, what does NFC gather? To prevent theft understand how it works. Typically CC#+ExpDate isn't enough, you need more to enable a transaction. This app is a great learning & demo tool. The source is publicly available! Always check app permissions. Don't blindly update. CC Reader has NO permission granted (phew)

I have had it for a while and have installed in all the devices at home. It is kids safe, and unless they know maths, they wont be able to download anything or change anything in setting without your consent. A bit of hassle having to download each song each time, but you only have to do it once.

It would be nice if someone from p&g responded to this but I'm sure the won't.  I only brought the brush for the Bluetooth features,  didn't realise I'd have to give one of the world's largest corporations my location to use it.

Can't scroll in app, jumps around. Tried uninstalling and reloading app, but no improvement.  They need to push a patch ASAP.

Even after giving a review, it asks for a review every time you close the app. I had the pro version for 10 minutes, but since I couldn't determine why the paid app needs permission to modify system settings (??? seriously ???), and because I couldn't tolerate the incessant begging for reviews, I uninstalled for a refund.

If you're using this as a crutch to read Facebook messages (without installing the Messenger app that requires every permission ever), then you'll get an app that does what you need it to do, but don't expect perfection.

Otherwise, works well.  --Nathan, Google Certified Educator

Plus the added private land info helps you find out who owns it and helps you try to get permission to expand your hunting areas

Sometimes it does it when there's something I want to screenshot that'd be lost if I rebooted. I've only used this once, but it works well enough. Only concern is some of the permissions and the bad wording that implies it will capture *all* of my activities when I just wanted a screenshot. It did take a screenshot successfully, though.

Specifically - the App requests the Location permission (I am using Android 6.x) and then holds on the GPS forever draining the battery. When disabling the Location permission, the app just hangs when you try scanning the bar code.  I am disabling the app and waiting for an update that will resolve the above and will honor my right to deny certain permissions without crashing.

Profile setting is a real bonus. I did not purchase it though.  Hexlock doesn't cover Quick settings mini-apps. For example, if I want to lock the ability to turn NFC on and off for privacy, I am able to lock the settings app, but NFC could still be turned on and off using Quick settings.  It would also be nice but not a dealbreaker if I could set a PIN longer than 4 digits.

I like the optional persistent notification, which can auto-detect your current location. Developer actually bothered to explain the permissions, which is sadly rare right now. App is small, battery-efficient, easy to use, and configurable.

However can you explain why you need the following permissions:  access to phone, access to contacts, access to location?   Android backs up my contacts to the cloud by default and you have no business having access to my wife's phone number.  You don't need to know where I am for me to use a WiFi device.   You shouldn't need access to the phone either.   Please remove these perms from your app, I don't know or trust you, or know if you are slurping my personal, private data.

It does not ask you, so you have to go to permissions in your Settings and allow it to access Camera.

However, this app downloads other apps without permission. Crappy little games like Cookie Jam and Bubble Pops started clogging up my phone immediately after this app was installed. There are no other apps on my phone that have ever done this. That's pretty pathetic of you, Birchbox. You should really have a chat with your app developer about it.

Discord is light, free with no ads, looks minimalistic and by no means bare-boned.

I'm pretty sure that the phone allows app permissions with fingerprint, but it doesn't work with this app, for what I can see, the app is great except for this big problem. PLEASE make a bug fix for fingerprint with the Huawei Nexus 6P! Thanks.

I downloaded this app simply to track my cycles. I would love a feature to keep my profile out of the community until I choose.

I also really appreciate Hammer & Chisels response time on my reviews when I had issues and questions.

I would appreciate if they improved privacy among their messaging to where they couldn't even read the messages between users, that would be some security! 9.5/10

Some dead/stuck pixels just cannot be fixed using this type of method. Thats not the dev.'s fault! This app does EXACTLY what it's supposed to do & it does it well. It has no unnecessary permissions & virtually no ad content. In fact this particular pixel fixer app has more positive results than others I've seen! So just because this didn't fix your problem you should not be penalizing the developer who is giving us a FREE shot at fixing our screens!

I can change display units for wind speed, temperature, etc. There are two major problems for me. First, it can't find my location.

Just too inconvenient.

I realised that Android has its own file manager hidden away in Settings, but it's too basic, so I'll keep this. My only criticisms of this app would be that the interface could be a little larger and that it could be a little easier to understand what all the buttons do, but I guess you could find out by long pressing them or by reading the included help file.

Even when given all possible permissions, every other article opens to a blank page that freezes and often leads to a crash. Sign out, clear cache, delete and reinstall: no improvement. Months of reviews here (many from paid premium users!) mention the same problems, but the developers do nothing. Since Instapaper’s purchase by Pinterest granted premium status to all users (though app settings only intermittently reflect this), the developers now have even less reason to fix these issues. It’s enough to drive users to resource-hogging Pocket.

Concentrate on the $800 phones instead of data gathering Apps that are stocked but don't work on most Motorola phones. Let people uninstall, especially when there no longer supported & cut out the apps with invasive permissions, remote access etc, even tho most don't require them, their just data gatherers & the rest are needless to users but Motorola market execs love them. Last Motorola item I'm purchasing.

My 6th grader now has a phone with age appropriate settings!  Thank YOU.  I can configure individual apps and browsers on a timer ... or lock them out completely.

Love the four-digit parent code to keep your kid from disabling or uninstalling.  I'm sold on Safe Lagoon.

The app won't detect other apps without giving it permission to read EVERYTHING that other apps are doing which is a huge security problem. Also this app keeps turning my notification sound and vibration on after each tree grows which is infuriating because I ALWAYS keep all notifications off. Additionally there are some usability problems, like too many taps required from app launch to starting a tree, etc. I want to love it!

I tested every top rated app and researched security and privacy. Only this app integrated smoothly with my business email. I would have gladly paid a one time fee of even $30. I don't like app subscriptions. My colleagues no longer wanted the app. I searched and found Alto, same seemless integration with bs Outlook, but no calendar. I'm sticking for now. Also has the best most responsive team. They built a great product.

Not able to turn TV on (not infrared capable-- network only). Permissions people are complaining about are for full features of the app (show times can be integrated to calendar, notifications on phone sent to TV). LG, if we don't want these features, we should not have to allow access and still be able to use the app. When running it does seem to use a fair chunk of power. Though it does not run in the background unless you want it to.

Can't sort restaurants shown by distance, time to deliver, time till open etc. App demands permissions it absolutely does not need to operate correctly, which is a big red flag.

If anyone is looking for an app like this, they know where to find it. Downloading it to my phone without my permission is underhanded and disgusting.

You have to use a non-rooted device. 2. You have to go into the permissions of the app and make sure all permissions are turned on.  With the s7, these permissions are usually off by default.

After following these steps you will definitely get an alarm before you pick up..... It will give you an alarm after the full charge...

This is the *only* app I have seen needing calendar/private info access _purely for ads_. Could allow rogue advertisers to steal personal data. Having a privacy policy does not prevent accidental exposure of personal data. The fact that privacy policy is needed shows that personal data is collected. Calendar perm must be dropped. There are better free apps now.  Some even ad-free. Now also needs Bluetooth perms. Really? What for?

However with the new security and privacy features I've returned and couldn't be happier. The large selection of themes doesn't hurt either!! A slick messaging app, with all the features you could want and more, security, deep customization, and features to get more out of your phone and messaging (text scheduling, fingerprint authentication, and more). Can't beat this app right now, stop using stock and get Evolve SMS!!

More significantly, it demands Facebook and location access, but has no practical advantage for either (like, seeing of you have friends in common), and you have to make a cuddli account anyway. There are less tedious and invasive ways to limit fake accounts. Basically, it has all the cons of tinder with none of the advantages.   Third, there are few users, and even less that are active (A notification when new matches appear might increase engagement).   Fourth, the privacy statement is either non-existent, or hard to find. Either way it is a bad sign.  Lastly, it is fairly limited in functionality and content. Your bio is limited to photos and a headline

So I am waiting for more unsolicited calls, emails, or worse. I don't mind the in-app advertising, but don't sell my info behind the scenes. UPDATE: Per the response below, I understand that the app is not currently collecting the info per the settings, but then why have the agreement when when downloading? It is not necessary.

I'm fine if the game doesn't pause if I get a call. It should be an option to allow the permission which newer android makes possible. Unfortunately the developers block that choice. Sound is bad and the speed feels lame and hinges partly on a screen \star field\ effect. Can't pick my own goal trance music to race to. Levels are bland and colorless - compare to the first Wipeout game.

I especially like its integration with my Nexus 6P's fingerprint sensor. I dedicated one star because as an app lock which purpose is to maintain your privacy, an intruder can bypass it by going into Android's recent apps if the program has already been running. From there, you can see partial content from the protected app. Like I said, this is a great app, but the one thing that can be improved upon is extending the privacy protection to the Android recent app view.

Takes so long to recharge energy. Also there is just way too many ads. I get they need to make money but I haven't played a game with that many ads in so long. I'm also very concerned that one of the permissions was to be able to make phone calls and access my contacts. Why on earth do you need access to that for a game????

Our cleaner came and did a great job for 3 hrs. He even cleaned the toaster crumb tray! But the app wanted us to be habitual users and the default is a bi weekly service. I only wanted the one time cleaning and had to delete my account to prevent the app from sending another cleaner. Kind of scummy of this company to force you into a bi weekly service without your permission.

I don't have an office phone or home phone for that matter that I would use this app for. For those that say it's easy to uninstall...it's a system app. It can't truly be deleted. I think the bigger issue is the fact that it was added and downloaded without my permission.

Setup with smartphone simple. App uses thin faint font making it hard to read. Maintains a history that has to be delt with one item at a time. No concern for privacy here and  no global delete except online at Amazon where they are collecting all this data about you. Way too long a load time. Lack of personal data use rates this app so poorly.

Or you can just read the news reports yourself. This is the 1st app that i''ve installed that didn't ask me for a load of permissions for info that they have no business needing anyhow. at first , the app had some minor glitches but we're quickly fixed. keep in mind that there is more content that's going to be added to this app on a regular basis.

There is NO reason you need access to my gooddamn contacts! It doesn't matter what it's for, it's not worth the privacy implications that come along with giving you that access.

After finally logging in, it asks for phone permissions, deny, I don't want that. App entirely stops working, won't respond to any inputs.  Reinstall, give it ALL the permissions, now it runs. Attempt to find devices, non-dismissable notification appears and doesn't go away. Attempt to link accounts so discovery works, fails on login after attempting for a few mins.

Otherwise it looks very clean. In reply to the developer's reply below: I had read the privacy policy. What I'm saying is that I would have rather had there be no need for that, no need for me to agree to anything that might scare a user. I would have preferred an app that just started and showed a compass when I first started it. (And since those exist, I prefer those.)

Separating free and the ad-free versions allows for reduced permission requirements of the ad-free one (well done!). Sadly, thougg, the forecast quality is often not even close to the actual weather conditions a day or two later. It often even fails to display the correct current weather situation and temperature. Also, the app's name under the icon is ridiculously long right now and there's certainly no need for the \Ad free\ in it (and the \14 days\ neither).

The light is nice and bright. The light stays on even if the app isn't on your screen. For me, that was a dealbreaker over other apps. If for any reason you need it, the app also lights up your screen in a variety of optional colors, woo-hoo! Bonus features.

Please fix the 'demo' I got scared by it suggesting I had to go from SF to the East Bay to then go to Palo Alto. I almost uninstalled it due to it. Luckily that never happened so far and most of matches were on my route. Please fix Android 7.0 location permission and profile pic bugs.

There is no way to view all guess, you have to view them in the preset individual categories (which you can't change, all divided on grooms sided or brides, no mutual friends category ect). There is also no way to export this guest list so I could print it, show it to anyone else, use it to help make a seating chart, or fill out invitations ect. The only way for anyone else to see it is to make them a collaborator which have the same permissions as me, I don't want them seeing everything else or being able to make changes. I just want to send them the guest list!

I've struggled to like it on android though. It has fewer features and doesn't sync well with other life tracking software. I actually free erred the old food tracking with photos & macro tracking.  The calorie tracker does not do as good a job as myfitnesspal so being able to import from that would be better than the included entry method. I am going to uninstall that app (again) though, because there is no way to change the privacy settings on my Galaxy s5.

Since I do everything on my phone, I need to be able to trust my VPN provider. Reviews I read were very positive and my three day trial sold me on their service. Glad I subscribed! The app has a major flaw though, it doesn't auto reconnect when your connection drops. This is a major problem, so I use openvpn for Android instead which reconnects as well as opens a vpn connection after rebooting.

But I rather use the website than the app. Like others have said, the app is too pushy with notifications.  Also I don't understand why it needs the permission to \make and manage phone calls\. Perhaps to verify my phone number as authentication, which I'd be OK with, but I'm not OK with Foodora being allowed to make calls...  So, uninstalling.

My family is spread out all over the world. We do not use any social media to keep in touch because we value our privacy. In a matter of a few days, however, everyone has been getting on board with a family \space\ and in the words of my brother, \this thing is mushrooming!\ with grandparents, cousins, nephews and nieces giving it a go. It is not easy to navigate but we are having a blast finally connecting online for what is literally the first time since the advent of the internet. Kudos to Google for being the first and only entity to offer an accessible, safe haven for us to share our private lives privately, and ad-free. We will enjoy it while it lasts.

The message is \Contacts access is needed to get your email address.\ This is patently false: the email address is already available to the app from the Google signin. Either remove this permission, or tell me honestly why you need it. UPDATE: the developer is working with me on the contacts access. It does appear to be an honest error which partially involves some bad Android system APIs, but I believe the issue is resolvable, and so far they have not done that.

Another cool thing would be if you could ask other users to possibly do a custom sketch for you to add to your private sketches (for people w/o drawing skills, like myself)

Old message: Still not working on Nexus 6P running 6.0.1 Press record button but always get \Cannot record audio during an ongoing call\ even after rebooting in Airplane mode.

Anyway you should be using OnAudioFocusListener instead.

I paused the music in my phone so the effects stop, started talking into the mic directly and tapping on it and nothing. Do they REALLY need the mic? I don't think so.

I used the Peel app for a little bit but did not find peels extra features very useful and did not appreciate its excessive permissions required or the fact its extras drained my battery faster. In contrast, IR Plus has worked better as a remote, doesn't have all the useless clutter and its more minimalist permissions (and size) make it a great fit for me. I'm very satisfied with this app.

Talked to Wahoo who wanted the debug log via Send Support Email. Cannot enable Debug Log and appliaction fails to send support email. Oh dear this app really hasn't been tested has it!! Otherwise Tickr-X connects ok and runs are recorded well enough. Shame you can't do anything with the data!!  Update! Permission for the app to access storage was not set for access. This stops all data prep it seems. So am now happy! Shame though this was not spotted by Wahoo support as I am sure it is a common issue.

App starts up on boot and tries to use Bluetooth on my phone every 5-10 seconds, leading to the phone in a constant awakened state when Bluetooth is turned on. App constantly asks for location permissions despite denying such access. I never had such bad battery life until this app is installed. The app is going to the trash!  Note to Sears: I don't need the app to startup on boot and scan around in the background to see if I am inside a Sears store. I can definitely tell myself. Simply forcing this behavior on your customers is unacceptable. I hope that you would reconsider this practice in the future.

My company doesn't even want this kind of control over my PERSONAL DEVICE that I also use for business! Did you forget about us, Google? The people who use our PERSONAL DEVICES for business? The Google Apps admin doesn't even have the option to turn this off so that I can continue using my device without agreeing to these ridiculous permissions. By implementing this policy (and forcing these permissions down our throat) you are driving small enterprises away from Google Apps and into other business solutions. You done messed up Go-o-gle!

With non-invasive permissions and an AMOLED theme to save battery I'm using Facebook again. I know it may be a web wrapper but the way it do it, allowing great customisation means you don't want to rush to uninstall it. It comes with some Twitter support as well, which could definitely benefit from the forced AMOLED theme, but it doesn't pretend to be a Twitter app. I'd love to see an option for merged timelines, and access to lists. Fingers crossed for future.

It has permission to use the camera as part of the TOS on install. The lady in the video talks about making sure your camera is given permission, yet does not tell you how to ensure that has happened. There is no dialog box I have found to give the app permission to use my camera. COMPLETE FAIL

You pledge to respect peoples privacy  but that's on the assumption we read the terms which we won't read because of how unclear they are and how inaccessible they are. Extremely unhappy and this is sketchy. Illuminati.

While requiring location services if the user wants to track routes is acceptable, requiring location just to pair means that Strivv is likely selling your personal fitness information to others without your explicit consent.  Without a good app it makes the tracker a much less attractive purchase.  Whether this is a Google thing or not is irrelevant.  Only developers can talk to Google.  Users can only complain to the Developers.   The rating stands.  I do not want to give up my personal information to Google just to get/stay fit.  If your reply would be that you have complained to Google many time (and could provide copies of these complaints) then I would not hold you accountable.  At present you are (the Concentration Guard argument of innocence does not work!).

My phone finally got the Marshmallow Android update so decided to give it another chance.  Marshmallow allows the user to limit permissions to each app that installed.  Reinstalled and so far, the app has requested none of the objectionable permissions that are listed.  I have been using this app for a couple weeks & have found it to be one of the better apps as far as being user friendly, easy to navigate and as an older person, I appreciate being able to easily read it.  The only reason I gave it four stars & not five is due to the fact that after you complete a survey, it's not always marking it off as completed.  Further, there were recently a couple surveys that I was not at all interested in and they should have some sort of indicator to use \not interested\ so that it stop showing up on the list (the list seems limited in a the number of surveys available at one time).  This way surveys could be replaced by ones more relevant to the user.    Note: they limit the rewards to the first 100-150 (as an example) people to complete so you never know whether you will be rewarded or not.

Please allow the calendar creator to set permissions on people invited to the calendar. In other words they can write but not erase events. And they can see but not write, etc. Also make it so the calendar creator can make events only viewable to certain people.   That way employees cant erase events!!!

I just wanna be able to constantly download and not have to exit and enter the app a million times. There's also another big where it constantly asks for permissions to access my storage. Please fix.

It just redirects you to company webpages inside the app in stead of a secure browser and half of them are not working. This app also requires some spy permissions. Honest apps only need your location. Not who's calling you. It just feels like this app has a hidden agenda. It's being advertised aggressively on Facebook.

I can't even have the app name I want which is only two words because you limit how long the name can be? My two words were 8 letters long and 9 letters long with one space in between for a total of 18 characters long. I know there are apps with way longer names than that. I am extremely dissatisfied and would have given you 0 Stars if that was an option. Marketing is everything and what is more important than the name?  And why does this app need permission control &make phone calls?

This game is fine, itself. It is a top down isometric action orpg with 3 classes. A warrior type class, a summoner, and a dps/CRIT based class. There is no customization, the classes are not gender locked, and the graphics are smooth. Controls are something to be scoffed at. You'd think with all the class advertising they did on Facebook with the woman's ass jiggling in the entire camera view, and trying to sell sex rather than their product, they'd have enough programming knowledge to properly have decent controls.   The company is nothing but false advertising and stealing videos for other games and pasting it as their own.   The game itself is a decent time waster if you're into repetitive arpg gameplay, but not worth more than a few hours of your time. EDIT: The permissions require the app to record audio when it pleases. Be wary of this.

It is also truly free in full functionality, although I am certain that as with most apps, free or otherwise, they mine as much personal information that is stored in your device, so beware. However, at least they ask permissions that if you refuse to give, the app won't work. In my case, when one of the permissions they require includes access to the phone and permission to use it, I just installed it on my tablet where you can grant permission but there is no phone. That seemed a it much and, obviously, I don't have it on my phone. Keep it simple and basic.

It says \/mnt/sdcard/SCOS\ when it should say \/storage/extSdCcard/SCOS\. I try to choose Custom, but it requires paid version. So I bought the paid version in order to enter the correct path, and still it fails. \unable to write in directory\. I have root, so to fix it, I modified the system permissions to allow apps to write to the external drive, and that solved the issue. But still, the \Memory Card\ default path is still wrong for my Note 2. Thanks.

It would take forever to go through that and the privacy policy for this one. What I saw was more \we'll track and stuff, and share it, but you're safe, fam. Trust us.\ Might be a great app. Might suck. And I may never know which it is.

That's crap. And the new look isn't great. When and where will I ever be around 49 other EU Megaboom speaker's?! That's a useless trick that No one asked or cares for. No need to change it up! The old version was vastly superior in being user friendly. A lot people who lived this app are now giving it 1 star. Do right by your customers and fix the issues with this new version.

Like everyone else, I keep getting asked for my zip code and then resets. One thing I do not like is the app keeps asking permission for my location and access to my pictures and camera, there is NO reason an app needs access to my photos. Still muddling through the app and so far, not impressed. Publix is the largest grocer in this area and should be embarrassed with this app representing them.

You must manually grant the location access.

The app auto imported 1 of my credit cards without my permission & have to manually delete purchases that are not company expenses.  I track my expenses in another program and couldn't get it to reconcile with Expensify.  Entered my expenses in Excel as well. That would reconcile with my personal finance program but not Expensify.

The fix is to revoke calendar permission access for the MS Band app which is silly but now my calendar has been stable for a few days. Otherwise the app is bland but has great data when you wear the band and nothing if you forget to put it on in the morning since it only uses the band to track activity.

It wasn't on my phone earlier last night and does not appear in my installed apps or all apps. Its useless junk and people should be able to uninstall 🐂💩like this. It's not right to push this crap on people without letting them know.  Seems like we have less and lees control over our phoned content, phones paid for by the people and regulated by google or whoever the jerks are, and less control over the functions of OUR PHONES, no privacy at all, very pissed abou

The ease of use comes with a range of protections for different needs from anonymity to access. I was so  happily impressed I sent the app download to some family and friends (aware that some wouldn't see my gesture as a favor). But when VPNs flood the app market in the age of NASA and cyber hack, standouts are all the more welcome and necessary.

Maybe it's me, but this app could trim some of it's asked for permissions. Why is it scanning my clipboard for tracking numbers without my permission? Legitimately, I see the camera permission to capture bar codes and the location permission to assist in finding other FedEx stores but that's about it. Thankfully, one can deny permissions within the phone settings.

As a Norton customer for my internet security across my devices for years, was very disappointed. Very unscrupulous behaviour especially for a company like Nortons that is supposed to protect you from scammers etc. Luckily I contacted Google Play and they were fantastic and promptly refunded my money. If offering trial versions just lock them at the end of the trial and if someone then chooses to continue using an app then you can prompt for consent for payment.

Now that this app is out, I think I know why. Not only does this app solve a problem that didn't exist, causing fragmentation for the majority of us who listen to multiple podcasts, it is very annoying to use. It autoplays new podcasts without asking permission, and insists that you log in. This kind of irritation is very unwelcome from a source such as NPR.

The main reason I like this app, in contrast to a few of the other glitch apps, is this app doesn't feel rushed as far as its dovelopment or UI goes, and it doesn't exibit any shady behavior or request permission for things it shouldn't need.  If you want a variety of different ways to inject creative digital distortion into your photos i definitely recommend it, and I would also suggest you get the paid version to realize the apps full potential.  There really is no down side i can think of. An undo button would be nice, but ive used it often for several months and haven't thought about it once while using the app. Mainly because with anything that involves randomization, it should be obvious that you save when you see something you like, and compare the various results after you have a few you like.

Search for error message: \GCV Media Server is unavailable\ returns 0 results.  Same with less frequent, message \~ unreachable\.  ES File Explorer has no problem reaching and availing of server, ruling out hardware or network config problem.  But only way to connect to internet + server is via this app.  So will have to RETURN DRIVE too.  Very angry at time wasted.  Even if app worked, almost zero config options (file manager, view, function, privacy etc etc).

Newegg hit its peak around 2009, 2010. You used to be able to place an order Monday morning and receive it by Wednesday afternoon with free shipping. Now if you choose there $1.99 superegg saver shipping you better be ready to wait a week and a half to get your merchandise. You can literally buy items from China with free shipping and receive them in the same amount of time that it takes Newegg.

Usually works flawlessly, however once in a while it has trouble loading lists of eligible items, even if you have good signal.  At first it would not work on my new phone and I had to manually go in and change the permissions to allow it to access my location.  Overall a very convenient app.

For Nas specifically,  acts like a folder player with its built in music file player,  pictures is viewable over Nas as well.   This makes it the best.   Works well with USB dongle for file transfers from thumb drive to phone with permissions enabled.   No driver needed or solid plug in for this to work on note 7

Still trying to find what the catch is! It's free, works offline and is easy to use! Keep it up Tubify! EDIT: FOUND THE CATCH so I have just looked through the permissions for this app and they actually have permission to interfere with your phone calls and make calls from your device, which sounds a bit shady in my opinion. Dropping you a star for that.

Just as Tunnelbear, Vikingvpn, NordVPN, Avira Phantom gave a satisfactory results. No Annoying pop-ups or notifications, Smooth, Error less Connection. I would have rated it 5 Star but it lacks at someplace: The speed at 'default' is many a time less then other locations. Secondly, I went through a couple of penetration test & Phantom VPN failed to completely protect user's privacy & security. I detailed a  mail to Avira team.

However I downloaded the app and then uninstalled it after 1 minute. I was disappointed to find that the app is nothing like as customisable as the standard webpage. No options for changing themes, privacy, appearance etc. Sorry DuckDuckGo but until these options are added to the app, I'll stick with the web version.

What is with all these permissions and forcing them upon users? In the same way I have campaigned for this app from the beginning I can go to the exact same forums to inform people. I am not using it until an update corrects this - don't be greedy with fetching metrics... And location? Why? Privacy - paying a premium for the dongle, don't want this type of intrusion. --edit-- changed the rating after app update that reviewed permissions.

You need access to make phone calls to \pause recording during calls\. If I deny that permission it's because I don't care for that feature. Uninstalling because app refuses to work without permissions to make phone calls.

I like reminding kids on Sunday evening what they might forget between Friday and Monday. I've even used it to find out who left the size 12 sneakers at the back of the room. Just learned that for safety, Remind allows no previous messages between teacher and student to be deleted,  which I think keeps everyone safer.  Guardians and administrators can join your class too. I love it.

When I open an app that is locked, it takes a good 3 to 10 seconds for the lock screen to finally pop up. That time span can make a huge difference from keeping​ your privacy to information/things being leaked to an unknown source instantly. So, I urge you to please consider making the response time more seamless and instant when locked apps are opened. Thanks.

It would be nice if it would include bus maps for the outer boroughs and even nicer if it would even have rail maps for the LIRR, Metro-North, and NJT. Maybe throw in the NYC Bike Map, and it would be perfect! The zoom feature could be more powerful, as the maximum zoom is okay but sometimes still a bit too small.

However, there are a few things I really really miss: 1. A basic search function. 2. The ability to mark messages as read/unread/important. 3. The ability to check on all the media exchanged in one chat and being able to send multiple pictures at once.   Please do something about these features and I'll gladly improve my rating! All the best guys! Grüße nach Berlin! 👍

You can submit reports on the birds you see at the time and location you see it. Helps scientists out. But it  wants me to pick a very specific location on a map that doesn't load up. If it did load I would rather be able to pick a broader location just for privacy reasons. 5 meter GPS coordinates when I spend most of my bird watching time on my own property is too close. Thanks but no thanks.

Major point for me is there are no odd permissions it's asking for. Only thing I'd like to see added is more text fields just to store some basic notes that don't fit the other fields.

This app tells you it will keep you from dangerous sites. Later a key pops up and I have trouble loading or getting to already trusted sites. NOW it's monitoring me ? Look I know we have no privacy, but I don't want Lookout reminding me every single second. Off course it's not loading.  It should tell you something that you can't keep it and turn it OFF.

The watch shows as \Please wait\. I have googled this a zillion times. I have read the reviews. NONE of them are clear - what little you can get. It says the google play services should match on phone and watch. That is fine. But what if they differ? I *think* the app has failed after 30d free service. And I would have to pay to continue using it. That is fine, but WTF - SAY THAT. I am guessing on everything as to what the issue is. At one point I may have seen a screen on permissions. I enabled everything. But it doesnt work. Whilst I admire the software - garbage and useless instructions are not a good sign. There is a FAQ on \Android 6.0 Marshmallow\ - on *WHAT*? The watch? Or phone? What if I am on 4.4 on my phone?

If your experiencing problems than most likely either it's your device or you don't have the required permissions from your administration. The GPS is not always on either some of these comments are just crazy. The only time the GPS comes on is where. When you punch in or out and only records the punch. If your company allows you can even turn it off so that it doesn't come on at all.

I certainly don't have time to go through them all very often but thanks to this app, they are already organised chronologically and it even auto-creates collages and animations from my related pictures.

I have had so much trouble staying connected to the VPN that I really dont think it is stable enough for privacy protection. I would really consider not buying this product. The app works well enough but is not suited for tablets. Doesnt automatically start when the devices does either. When its running your battery wont last 1/4 of its expected time. Over all find a beter privacy VPN than this one.I always connect to 465. Impossible to maintain connection long enough to stream anything. Even your ultra fast tv usa is to slow to handle low quality streams.

The MMS messages come through instantly. It is so easy to send from the web. It beats the other text-to-web apps hands down. This is a great app, even without the premium features. I don't know how private any of these web texting apps are, but if privacy is not an issue for you, go with MySMS. All of the others are imitators.

I should be able to send a file to another app even if it has no permission for it (copy it to a temp location). Also there seems to be no way to paste a file into a empty folder. You need to long press on an existing file to get the menu. I'd love to give it 5 stars if these things are fixed.

There's also no way to choose hours where I don't want notifications. Maybe there is a real settings menu but I could only find a place to change my name.  (Edit) for the developer. I personally would like it more of I could edit the time settings myself. With the location, some way of the user being able to see our understand what's being shown about location to other users. Otherwise, thanks for the quick response and keep up the great work.

I have personally had the app crash, lag, messages not sent, and every chat blank. I have had to uninstall and reinstall the app multiple times to fix the problems. There should be a way to switch accounts without having to uninstall the app. Other than the bugs though, the community is really amazing and welcoming, but if you're thinking about downloading it, watch out for those \literate\ assholes. UPDATE: Now it keeps asking me for permission everytime.

Open settings, go to apps, and click on the Microsoft Health app.  3. Open the permission section and manually turn on all the permissions.  4. Back out of app/settings, reboot and then open the app.  For me, after doing this, it opened and I was able to pair and sync my Band 2 with my Nexus 6P running Android N.  It appears that the app doesn't know to ask the OS for the permissions, so since it doesn't have them, it just crashes upon opening.  Hopefully this work for some folks.

It's so important that you had to block me from using the app.  That update?  Add the permission \Read your Web bookmarks and history\ that could contain usernames, passwords, or other IDs... no thanks!

I like the privacy settings but I think that they should limit what's available in the free version and make more of those features value-added functions exclusive to Premium Subscribers.

It tracks my walking route and records pace, etc.  It lets me share my walls with Facebook friends.   It does NOT ask for a zillion permissions, access to cameras, mic, friends or the soul of my firstborn child  as do many similar apps.  It's a good choice.

This app itself is worth having on your phone and using wherever possible. It is easy to configure a multi-layer proxy and integrates with many other privacy-aware apps. Use it in conjunction with a firewall and build a fortress for your Android. Relay if you can!

Go into your app menu on your home screen. Uninstall all lg tone, Lg BT reader, tone and talk, Lg Of old version, and any other sms and app reader. Now go back after uninstalling and be sure they are all gone. Now go to the Google play store and type in Tone & Talk and click search. It will show you tons of other junk. The 1st one should say LG Tone and talk. Install that one, since its a newly installed app it will ask you for permissions on about 4 categories. Approve and test!

There is no way I trust you with that level of access and information. Maybe if you get yourself bought out by Google I'll come back (they know everything anyway...) but for now I have to uninstall it. ### Apparently the developer changed the permissions. Hence changing rating to be fair and respect the work going into this free app, but did not personally verify.

And even it asked you for the photo,  which asks your permission for the gallery, or otherwise you can't go on.

Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't even reset the setup procedure. Then it crashes after being granted file permissions. When you try it again you just get a blank screen when trying to find the rom image that you downloaded yourself, because the built in downloader doesn't work. Where is it looking for the rom files? Is it even looking at all? There's no way to know because the app tells you nothing.

WTF guys.  There's so much broken with this app:   * the phone number verification is broken - clicking on the verification link from the text just showed a blob of JSON code  * You must enter your credit card info manually - the app doesn't support Android Pay or scanning cards.  * Text input is broken - the cursor often gets before (instead of after) the last character.  * Blank screen when it first starts - had to kill and restart  * Says nothing about Eaze also delivering MMJ  Gah. Facepalm. If I didn't already give them all my details, I would just use Nugg or HelloMD.

The app will not allow you to use it at all unless it has access to every single one of the list of permissions it wants, and there's no good reason it should need some of them. Any attempt to deny or revoke any of those permissions causes the app to throw up a dialog that can't be dismissed saying \hey, I need these permissions, go turn them back on\ if you want to use the app.  It's watch app on my moto 360 seems to do a reasonable job of keeping track of things, which is why I went to grab this app in the hope that adding the mobile app might make it easier to check out the data the watch has been logging. So I thought \I'll turn on the google fit integration and get all this data in one place\. Like that was ever going to go smoothly. It didn't add any activity data into google fit that I can see, but what it did do was take the approximate weight value I entered while signing up and log that into google fit as a measurement. A measurement I can't delete, and now I also can't see any data in google fit from the app I *actually* use to track my weight. Thanks Motorola, really helpful there.

I didn't even get one task set up before it crashed. That did it for me, you make your own decisions. Try Loop Habit Tracker instead. Needs no special permissions, as an app like this should not, and it hasn't crashed yet.

Probably a permission thing. It seems to recognize okay, but (I'm guessing) crashes when trying to save.

It requires permissions for many items outside of what is needed, plus a sign in to a separate account to access many features. It also intrudes itself into my phone's notification area for no apparent reason. Would be useful otherwise

It would also be awesome to have it for Laptop computers as well!  One thing, needs more bandwidth ! This is the only VPN service we can trust next to Opendns !  It will be so much good to have it with all in one Norton Antivirus ! Life gets a little easier with affordable security and privacy!    Hope Norton will come up with secure DNS service as well!

I refused to grant access to my contacts so the app wouldnt install. However it immediately started messaging on my Facebook/social media when I didnt want it. Those permissions should be strictly optional and are a terrible abuse of user opt-ins. I will go on FB and de-rate this app and make formal complaints to Google.

The features it includes by default are top notch. I also like the timed message removal option. This in my opinion adds a layer of security and privacy which before using Wickr I hadn't seen in a messaging app, at least by default. When it comes to the Account Security features I'm also impressed with Default settings. Keep up the good work Wickr!!!

Wire was everything I wanted and more, as it offered e2e video calling too! The app is very sleek and runs smoothly. My only wishes would be the option to turn on read receipts (or, to protect privacy, to turn on for only certain contacts), a place where I can see all the media that's been sent (photos, links, etc), and the ability to access messaging while video calling. Great job!

This mobile app is great, but I need to be able to manage the server why roles and permissions because is something happens when I'm on the go I won't be able to handle the situation until in get home. However, this app is amazing. The push to talk is very useful and being able to stay live with your server is great. All we need now is to be able to edit *more* of the server. (channels, perms, roles, and ect). Amazing!

If you do a lot of online shopping and aren't choosy about from whom you buy, you'll probably like this app. When paired with the SwagBucks TV app, you can earn a $3 Amazon gift card in about a month. You could get it faster if you're willing to actually sign up for a bunch of other sites that they advertise.  And then there's the surveys.  They were innocuous at first. But now, every single survey the app gives me starts off by asking for my name, address, and phone number. Oh HELL no! No survey posted by anyone with integrity will want that kind of personal information. I get demographic questions, but you want to tie my responses to me personally? And with a privacy policy that flat-out says that they're providing this information to third-party advertisers? I don't think so.  So yesterday I got an email from SwagBucks saying that I had enough points for a $3 Amazon gift card. And I claimed it, and a day later I haven't received it (they say it can take up to 10 days -- Lucktastic pays immediately). As soon as I do, I'm closing my account.  I could get paid more to make iPhones in China as slave labor than what SwagBucks pays for the time invested.

I had instafollow, but all of a sudden, my ability to see my unfollowers ended and all I could see was statistics.

This app is rated teen... And children now have this on their phone and have to repeatedly ask their parents to get it off, which will leave parents angry to find out some stupid company installed their app on their child's phone without permission. That's not a good marketing strategy. Please learn from this mistake.

Uninstald it, then install it again giving it all permissions necessary. Problem still remains, and my rating. I will uninstall and newer use or recomend this junk.

With the extra permissions required for the advanced cleaning I just use it every once in awhile then turn it back off.      You got to watch what you allowed to delete on the advanced cleaning though.          I don't like the part at the end where it says  Those other cleaners can eat the corn out of my shit!

They just charged me $40 **without** my permission at all.  I'm not paying for 3 years of tolls  in advance  No, way to contact them from the app.    Several years ago I bought a tag & account but they refused to ever activate it or even admit I had an account.

This is what they want you to give up:  This app has access to: Identity Uses one or more of: accounts on the device, profile data Contacts/Calendar Uses one or more of: calendar, contact information Location Uses the device's location Phone Uses one or more of: phone, call log. Charges may apply. Photos/Media/Files Uses one or more of: files on the device such as images, videos, or audio, the device's external storage Camera/Microphone Uses one or more of: camera(s), microphone(s) Device ID & call information Allows the app to determine the phone number and device IDs, whether a call is active, and the remote number connected by a call.

Most photos include more than one child, and by design, the Tadpole app will not permit you to download photos of your children that have any other child in the photo with your child. Wait what? Tadpole thinks it's doing other kids a favor to prevent you from downloading photos of your child with that child. Tadpole does this to protect what it calls \anonymity,\ which is the wrong word usage, but I believe they mean *privacy.* If parents want to save a photo of their child that happens to include another child in the photo, parents must take screenshots on their mobile phone or desktop. This is a policy that is void of any rational basis because: 1. I see those other children every time I pick up and drop off my children from school

This application works only with a single OneTouch meter, which is not clearly stated in the communications from LifeScan/OneTouch that directed me here.  2. The software does not have an appropriate medical data (HIPPA) privacy policy. The one attached to the app is all standard advertising bull-pucky.  That's fine - as far as it goes - but the data collected by my diabetes meter is protected medical information.

I started with the free trial when this app set came out, and it is more complete and effective than any other I've tried.   Lots of people are worried about the government watching their internet activity. I am too. I'm much more worried about companies spying on me. We give them the right to do it when we get a loyalty card at the grocery or install an app. They do it without permission using facial id software, credit cards and checks.  I have no plans of going off the grid, but I love making more active decisions about my apps using Bitdefender. You will be floored at the stupid apps that leak your info. I'm not getting rid of Google or my text to voice apps, but I did get rid of some games and store apps. Try it and be awed by who has your data. Use the info to limit your exposure and decide what apps are worth the risks.

Then it started giving us an error and refusing to accept our password.  There was seemingly nothing we could do.  The problem was solved by 1) Uninstalling OneClickDigital, 2) powering off the phone, 3) powering the phone back on, 4) Reinstalling OneClickDigital, 5) entering account info again (including remembering the password).  I don't see any way to reset your password or to get a reminder of your password but, fortunately, we remembered our passwords when we reinstalled the app.  The only other thing we had to do to get it to download audiobooks was that the first time we tried to download, a box popped up that said the app needed permission to access our storage.  You just click \OK\ on this pop-up.  As for the App itself, I find it just as non-intuitive as the other audio book apps I use, but it's usable and gets the job done.

It's f-ed up the font for many websites, such as wikipedia which now has font too large to read properly. Not to mention that the swaped around a bunch of buttons for no good reason. They also ruined the text highlight tool.

No ads, no permissions, incredibly small footprint, responsive and easy to read display, able to separately calibrate each side...The only problem is that it's too easy to hit the calibrate button.  All it takes is a quick tap and whatever side you were working on will be off until you can find a perfectly level surface again. Hold for 3 seconds to calibrate would be better. Still better than anything else tho

Lots of surveys where you're pretty much finished (spent 20+ minutes) and then they say that the survey is \not for you\ which just makes it a waste of time. Did make $50 in about 4 months though, so 2 stars instead of 1. Would have kept it if the privacy policy wasn't updated since it's something to do when you're bored.

This app goes with the former. However, many of the wallpapers are overtly amateurish. This would be fine if it were an art orientated app, but because it's a wallpaper app, there shouldn't be any amateurish works. Another gripe I have with the app is its aggressive ads especially since the developer probably hasn't asked for permission to upload these artworks.

After numerous deletions of other apps, I finally found the culprit.  Why does this app seem to think it needs constant internet access. Like I said. Check your balance and either disable or delete it until you want to use it again. FWIW, in my opinion,  this app is probably just transmitting all the data you give it permission to access

Restricts chatting for 'privacy' but displays their location for anybody to see. Priorities for a chatting app are spot on. Also in general have no respect for apps feeding off the buzz of another app. Also the chat filter settings suck, if you want any decent conversation you need to spoof your location to a major hub.

I suggest create a party leader or \dj\ to control which phones can play music either by making it alternate between phones in an order or allow the dj to choose the permissions. And make it so background noises on people's phone do not interupt

With this app if you deny phone or calendar the app exits immediately rather than working (like so many other apps are able to do). This is terrible, you don't need these permissions to use the app as a cursor or volume control. Can you please correct this?

In fact, every bit of your information IS personally identifiable, as it is all connected to your username, AND is available to the public since it has a social aspect to it. I did NOT agree to these terms. Would you? UPDATE: is there another Insight Network Inc? No. If you only collect \email, password and location\ why not list and limit your \Privacy\ policy to JUST that?!

This can be cheaper than owning your own car! Unlike most car services, you do not have to return the car where it came from. Free parking at meters! Great customer service. Only 2 major complaints & 3 minor ones: 1) There are often no cars within 1 mile, even though I'm in the middle of their area. 2) In the cold, cars detecting dead battery don't notify the app. 3) The map rotates, but has no button to re-align. 4) The car radios default to ON. 5) Unnecessary permissions.

I can't get rid of this permission warning on my phone. These warnings keep popping up and I cannot stop it from doing this unless I turn the app off ( To turn app off if it gives you problems go to settings > applications >  Downloaded scroll to the my account and tap it then at the top should be a button marked force stop click it. A warning pops up klick ok the app will no longer be running in the background at start up. You can still launch it by tapping its icon.  I am using an Alcatel one touch for tracfone  it should not have these issues. All the app does is let you buy airtime and other tracfone products. I can do this on their website. To check my balance I have to send a message to *777*1# this should be on my phone. Overall a lousy product. Also I have the latest version (R1.8 ) and reading the reviews there is supposed to be a widget showing my airtime I don't have one, again  LOUSY PRODUCT

And admittedly, it was/is spot-on with regards to relationships, and my overall 2017 goal with its yearly forecast. I had to plough through 10+ horoscope apps before I found this relatively permissions friendly one. Most require data-draining precise location, which for an app that does not require such an advertising spyware type of permission to work, is always a deal-breaker for me. SUGGESTION: While I am straight, many people are gay, and same sex compatibility should be offered. I would also like to know how I would get along with with potential same sex people as platonic friends.

What's worse if you later decide to remove your account (you actually have to email them) with hopes to stop them from having further access to your data, you're out of luck. Their privacy policy (as of Aug 19, 2016) states on this regard: \...If Your account is deactivated, We may retain Personal Information that You have previously chosen to provide us. ...\  If loss of privacy is not an issue for you then go ahead and install it, it's a nice app.

For whatever reason, the install isn't able to set this automatically. *****  Same as others here. App won't recognize that reader is connected. I know the reader works great because it connects immediately with an iPhone and lights up like a Christmas tree. It's the app not detecting the reader and not the phone. The phone's warning message about listening at high volumes comes up when reader is plugged in. I sure hope they can someday support more than a handful of android based phones! Until then, I will need to lug around this old iPhone and pray that everyone has wi-fi for me!

Almost impeccable, I'd say. But lately it refuses to open books from \Last opened\, some of them, not all of them. But what worse, after I got the error message, my File Manager and other such programs suddenly refuse to see my SD Card (where all my books are). The cure: restart my smartphone and work until I need to jump to some of the \Last opened\. And then... (see above). What gives???  Another thing: AlReader stopped working with big ePub files (I mean BIG, like 40 and more Mb). Beep-beep! Error, my man! You little bastard, but you could work with the same files without sweat!  Still, the most annoying is the situation when, after being unable to open a book from the \Last opened\ the program cuts off the rest of the software from my SD card. Neither file managers nor other readers can see the external card. My guess: AlReader after the \error\ situation (and WHY error???) changes some permissions. So, 3 stars instead of 5.

I would give it 5 if it worked properly. None of the email or missed call links update and always shows zero even after I gave all the permissions. Also it's very bright even with the dark them and at 1 brightness level so is it possible to put brightness toggle in the app settings? Further, Is it possible to add brightness level in the settings to lower even below the embedded ones? Shortcuts to missed call should open the phone on the wear as well. But nice work generally

Other developers should take note of how to develop & deliver apps to end user. This is the correct way to build a brand & attract customers via free apps. Keep up the good work of targeted ad free software. If you need to promote other apps you develop, integrate as a menu heading with a end user tap to open the link, but never targeted..  U have set a decent std.

Then they removed the game — only they didn't really remove it, they just disabled it, so the app is *still* twice as large as it needs to be, and *still* requires the camera permission — now for no reason. So sloppy. I've stayed at version 1.5 of the app, to avoid the bloat, but now I don't even get FOTD notifications, so it's almost useless to me. Ugh.

The moment I open it, it just spams me with permission pop ups even though I've already allowed them. Then it constantly complains about a screen overlay draw, which I've disabled countless times. Which just instantly force closes the app.

I just wanted to gush a bit, it's a great app that I didn't know I needed until I had it, the paid extra bits are totally worth it too! Only problem, my permissions keep resetting to Off for Energy Bar sometimes. Is that a RAM issue or my phone trying to save battery? Currently using rooted Nexus 5X.

Definitely doesn't work as a standalone sales method. The new shop updates feature is a perfect idea for this mobile app. Had some issues getting it working at first. I tried giving the app permission to access my storage, but in order to do that it says I have to turn off screen overlay. Turns out the app can't access pictures if Twilight is running. If you use Twilight, pause it while accessing pictures through the Etsy app. Only issue I have so far

I will be unloading my storage locker this year to stop the $145/mo drain...I figure that's a cruise every year!!!  One thing I would improve is to add a 15 mile range+pic edit.

Smaller app and much less of a battery drain - it essentially utilises the Facebook mobile site. No forced messenger app so you can remove that too. No nosey permission requirements. Option to add a toolbar to your quick access menu so you can easily check messages, notifications etc by bringing up a pop-up. This is a highly recommended replacement. Five stars.

No, that is too invasive. Since I can't upload my steps, because I don't want to give you my location information, the app is not useful to me.  Response to CS: I realize that you have to allow location consent to use bluetooth, and I understand why. But, this app actually requires one to enable gps/location services in order to upload steps. It will not upload steps without location services on. There is no reason you need to know my GPS location for uploading my steps. I will not allow some one to track my location in exchange for uploading steps over bluetooth. The fact that you require one to enable GPS is why I call this app invasive.

In addition to privacy, I have the ability to request reminders, tag my subjects, use a header for easily scrolling through my topics, add an image, and append a location and/or temperature to my posts. I've been trying to do a daily post under the header of \Haiku My Day\ and that keeps it simple enough to record my day with enough creativity to enjoy the act of journaling it.

Edit: I'll try again and check the error message. But it looks like a bug in \something\, when I connected my Microsoft foldable keyboard, every time I did something that required keyboard, there was two crashes with Chrooma.  Update: Ok now I'm not sure anymore, this doesn't happen with my Note 3 with custom rom, but happens with Galaxy Tab S2 with original rom. The exception is java.lang.SecurityException Permission denial: get/set setting for user asks to run as user -2 but is calling from user 0

Pls fix it. Other than that, the folder organization, password protection and lack of any internet permission is great.

They want you to download the apps claiming free credits yet any credits over 2 free credits you will NEVER get. They never gave me the free credits for the free cell phone. It's snake developers like this who Google shouldn't allow to have any kind of apps. They LIE and have you download apps just to steal your information and invade your privacy and this app isn't free to use when you have to buy the credits.

However, this app is the worst I have ever used when it comes to ads. You're really going to forcefully open the Google Play store to not just one, but TWO different apps WITHOUT my consent? After a few minutes of use, it forcefully opened two apps without me clicking anything at all. After backing out of both, it did it AGAIN after only a few seconds. The little banner ad was fine, but this is unethical. Bye.

It's permissions are set to off (greyed out) and cannot be changed. Your app does not recognize that it's off. I cannot add the teackr as this permission does not work at all.whats the trick?

Also, the app kept showing very old listings as brand new ones and was entirely unhelpful. Edit: got refunded pretty quickly, so that's nice, but still not very cool to be charged without permission. Maybe you should update the app to prompt people on if they want to renew a subscription instead of doing it automatically.

Asks to make phone calls, can't imagine why it would need to do that - denied. Asks to read my calendar, can't imagine why it would need to do that - denied... Exits to the home screen without any user interaction. I assume it's quitting because I'm denying it these spyware permissions, which of course defeats the purpose of the new permissions model, but even if it's just plain crashing, it's broken.

The interface is much improved, and seems more responsive. However, two things:. Why does it require permissions to make phone calls and texts or access to my pictures??  Absolutely unnecessary.  Also, the payment type choice as a scroll is a bad idea.  It's not clear it was a scroll, should just be a dropdown.  Don't get too fancy here.  Overall improved though!

I need to have overlay off on my phone to give location permission but once it's off it doesn't let me give location permission  because it wants to have overlay on before it gets the other permissions. This is a bit ridiculous.

Your work wants to see if you are walking or riding in a car. It has access to your messages and calls , can track who you text and how much you talk to someone as opposed to other contacts in your phone. Companies that use this are criminals and need to be put in jail. I am not kidding about this. This app has more permissions and access to more stuff than Google does. If any of you are wondering why you got fired for something you didn't do ...here is your answer.

It's always crashing, it's constantly asking for permission to access everything on my phone even though I said DENY and DON'T ASK AGAIN.  It crashes every time I looked at an item, can't hold the filters I set. Not worth the aggravation.  Don't install people...it will ruin your day out of frustration.

And THEN, fails to connect the my device?  This used to be a GREAT app, until Weber took over and ruined it.  I used to recommend these to friends, now I warn them to stay away.  Sell the company back to iDevices and maybe it won't suck so much again.  Oh and Weber, don't bother telling me to call customer support again.  This device used to work flawlessly, and I while I'm in the middle of grilling the last thing I need is to sit on hold waiting for tech support.  Screw it, I'll do it the old fashion way.  Update, so in response to the Weber response - how do I skip the registration and GPS privacy breach?  Until that's gone, my review remains a 1 or less if I could.  Also, taking out the battery is a non-solution when you are slow cooking and the app freezes and doesn't let you know you just burnt the s*it out of a turkey or brisket.

So I  went into my phones settings and went to application manager, selected this app and changed the permission to accept. My main problem with this app is it wont shut down after I push back, I always have to hit my home key or it keeps loading and I end up re-downloading the app!!

The Verizon Gestapo acts like they not only own my phone but me as well.   Worse the garbage app can't be uninstalled. Don't want it. Did not give permission for it to pig out on my phone storage, can't get rid of it.  Hate it? It is making me hate Verizon.

Along with the reports of russian military hacking computers and bank accounts. I decided it would be best to uninstall this app, if you are going to get this app act WITH EXTREME CAOUTION.

While i can see how this would be useful for the spam that defaults to on, I can't find a legitimate reason for it for brushing teeth. The privacy policy and the terms are designed to not be read (large quantities of small, faint text, horizontal scrolling. Privacy policy looks like it's divided up into useful sections that you have to navigate to, but actually leads to fluff text that says nothing so you have to click more info.) It just feels really dodgy.

My car's native screen displays it,so I have to exit Android Auto just to see it. I haven't seen a new app like Waze or any others which indicates that this might not have much of a future.    Also, it crashes more than any other Android app I have running and has problems re-connecting after I turn off my ignition.  Google maps has a long way to go to be useful also, streets and street names are rendered too small to see which causes me to spend more time trying to read them.  The app also seems to drain my battery faster than the car can charge it.  And why, when my vehicle has WiFi, bluetooth and inductive charging, do I have to tether it?  Why why oh why do I have to keep granting it and re-granting it permissions in Marshmallow?  I'll go to make a call while driving only to see that I must pull over and grant AA permissions...again.

It wouldn't bother to pop up anywhere and only saw it when I tapped to use it. Once I did the update it's put up a charging screen which I never gave permission to start working.

Those apps don't even sync to Google drive properly, while this app is beautiful and works nearly perfectly.

Wire fulfills everything you need in a chat application. It's a true Skype replacement, a good messenger replacement, and has a beautiful interface. I love having inline videos and audio. I like having a dedicated desktop application. The interface, while beautiful, can be a little cumbersome. I hope they add a dedicated GIF button instead. Maybe some more bots. Loved the Boten Anna nod.  I have a few complaints about the desktop app but the android app is top notch and probably the best you'll find.

Scrolling down through reviews, I'm very skeptical of a lot of the 5 star posts, almost all of them include a promo code, which makes me suspicious that the company is paying for people to post. There are a of unhappy people out there.

Whether it be for personal protection, esthetic purposes or privacy, the door handle has proven itself time and time again to be a much needed part of any door. The complexity of the handle can be exemplified through its significant versatility, variation and longevity over the course of humanity's existence.

They cannot see our posts due to privacy laws either.

However, my daughter has an iPhone and I have an Android. To change anything I have to install it on her phone, manage it, then uninstall it. Please make an Android or at least web parental control. Also, for my daughter to install things she has to request permission from the app store, so this makes installing the fix that makes her icons not rearrange, impossible. It's not a deal breaker though. Web admin portal or Android portal for parents is a must.

It often says it can't find a usable connection yet all other apps can. When you do manage to get it to work for more than a few seconds, it protects your privacy by virtually blocking all access to the Internet. A page that would load in 0.02 seconds may require 10 minutes when the VPN is active. Typically though, you'll activate it just to see it disconnect itself as soon as you switch to another tab or the home screen.

Permissions are required as follows:     Access to contacts – We use this permission to access Android’s account manager which we use to securely store your FedEx user id and password.  Access to photos, media and files on the device – Used to copy your user information and shipments from the older version of the app to this upgrade.

I cannot recommend people from my soccer team install this and use it, potentially opening thier own phones to harm.  Restrict permissions to only those necessary and this would be a good app to organise my soccer team.

What it doesn't tell you is that even though the Facebook permission only gives it access to your friends list, it automatically sends a request to every friend in your friends list to download the app, without your permission. Very misleading, completely unacceptable

Incentives for sharing with your entire phone book. Lost a day in damage control and praying that even minimal contacts were privy to my most private moments, pictures from my past and identity theft information. These people will be sued in the future. I am sure of that. They barely explain all the exposure you will be inviting by allowing their permissions.

I'll keep that notification there all the time if I have to. I'm not allowing my school to spy on me. They auto enrolled me in this bulls**t.  Privacy is a good thing.

I'm only on level 3 & it's a little elemental but I do not like that it as Auto starts & stays on therefore draining my battery faster and I will probably be deleting this as I have too many apps that autostart and I'm not thrilled about its level of access. Some information & capabilities is not necessary but for you to have or having the capabilities to change things without permission I just don't think you need or that that capabilities are appropriate

Question to support asking for clarification remain ignored. A mistake obviously buying a productfrom this vendor. Device still requires permanent Internet access regardless of use case. Forced dependency to Bose online account and the usual user data exploitation that seems common today. App covers only 40% of basic management features. Development takes ages. Equalizer is just one example. App development is certainly not Bose's stongest suit. Intersting as well every 5 star rating gets a 'thank you for valuable feedback' while customers not happy are largely ignored. What happened to a once great company building excellent products?

It uploads all your photos to their server whether you want it to or not. They say they protect your privacy and don't use your pics for advertising but then send out emails with your pics attached. Email is not secure. They make it very difficult to delete your photos from their server. Each photo must be deleted individually one at a time. They fool people into giving them all of their contact information and send misleading text messages to all contacts.

After I purchased a Google Maps card, I started to find properties all around me that I thought were off boundaries to hunting but quickly found out that was not the case. Also, with knowing properties are available, this also gives me the names of the owners so I can walk right up to their house and ask for the permission to hunt, or find the state owned lands and ask the state government to hunt their. Hopefully this \spring time scouting\ will allow me more hunting opportunities in my home town area resulting in more days in the field and a full freezer

It also doesn't require account information or even interact with the Pokemon Go app in any way aside from visually, or any permissions other than being able to appear over other apps, so it's safe and legal to use.

Everything should be good from there. That's how I did it and hope it helps you all.

I haven't explored all the options,  but it works well at night for when I am winding down,  and morning winding up. You can set a timer for it as well and there is a taskbar and onscreen widget,  you can toggle on and off.

The cell phone person in the store couldn't make it work either. All settings on the phone were correct, location was turned on,  permission was given to the app & phone was connected to store Wi-Fi. Had to type in all the barcodes to use the app. Self check registers would have been faster. Update 10/23/16 Now working properly with barcode scanner the last several times in store. Don't know if a bug was fixed or if the problem was with the store's spotty wifi

That simple. Well done Garmin.  Old: No warning, no indication, no sign. Smart notifications automatically turn itself off randomly. When I try to re-enable, it asks for the notification permissions to be enabled in the system settings. Turning them off and on again works until next time. Used to work perfectly without issues but now broken... Very unhappy as this is super important to me.

It \asked\ permission to just be confirmed as a browser, not imply that it should be the default browser. It sent local videos from my phone which is about all the other ones even do. And it actually sent videos to my Roku from the web and even has full compatibility and control with playing those videos on the web. So far I love everything about this app and am so relieved that someone actually finally did it!

It's great that it's free & I like the more ads by seller link. Picture quality does suck horribly. I have posted pictures of furniture later to find my pics are only a big blur. This is super frustrating considering  the amount of time energy & effort put into this. Lags at times and permissions seem more than others but I love ksl & appreciate the website for sure:)

Does this every time I open it.  If I reopen it immediately it works.  I have all permissions enable and send feedback reports every time but they seem to fall on deaf ears.

Even when you send out a push message to get the location it never works. This is despite giving the app location permissions specifically.

The removal process on the website is not very straight forward even when following the FAQ.  I feel the app is a bit cavalier with the permissions it forces on you..  Not recommended.

I've tried reinstalling and checking permissions but can not get it to work. Bit upsetting that I lost my countdowns. Will wait for an update and change my rating when it's working again. Edit: take it back, it is working. It's just an ad that isn't loading for a looonnnggg time so it's white until it loads and you x out of the ad. Still should be fixed.

Game runs good, leveling system is linear though. Makes for a reason to keep playing, instead of just having everything off the bat. Not permission intrusive which is a huge plus. Advertisement is optional. Great game all in all.

Automatically signs you up without your permission.  It forces you into a 15 day trial and will charge you afterwards.  Claims you can cancel anytime... Only if your pc is near by.  They block your browser that you signed up with, and continually send more trial links to make you give up.  Scam!

However it has some issues. 1) recent update asks for many more permissions than I would expect.      for example, why does it need bluetooth info or camera or media files, or my contacts?  2) the way your carribou id is stored requires access to the network.  This can be frustrating when you are in a hurry to get a coffee. I open the app at a caribou to get my card to scan. app fails because it can't access the caribou wifi to pull my card out of the cloud.  wifi cant be accessed because you need to open a browser first to connect to the carribou wifi to accept the terms.  The card info should be in the app by default and not require a net connection to use.   Great app to use when it works, but more  fussy than it needs to be (and requires more access than it should).

I would rate higher, but the app and its permissions (my phone calls, come on) are terrible.

I have been very pleased with their cost, selection, and customer service.  Right now, I can say this is the service I recommend to anyone concerned about online privacy. I have the app installed on my Samsung Galaxy S4. The VPN drops it's connection regularly and requires me to stop, then restart, the service. Unreliable but better than it used to be.

Pop up messages from app do not relate to my phone - a Note 5.  Permissions and screen overlays are the problem.  All's good when you get it working.  Excellent accuracy - a seriously useful tool. However, the keyboard keeps popping up and down each time I touch the screen to scroll, very distracting hopefully there is a setting for that.

It seems quite unnecessary for a language learning app. Why would this app possibly need to read and send  text messages and know who I'm calling? Why does it want to know who's phone numbers I have? Edit: just emailed support with this as dev reply suggested. Will update review when they reply.

I tried atleast a half dozen similar apps and nothing came close to Daff imho. The complete lack of annoying ads, no unnecessary or highly intrusive permissions...

I did read the privacy policy and user agreement word for word. I am not a lawyer, but both articles were worded in a manner that at least made me feel safe enough to use the service. I only hope that I did not make some regrettable oversight while reading. For now, however, I am very pleased. I also use Good Rx, which saves me around $15 more than Blink on my other medication.

I've read comments from app developers that it's a privacy issue: this makes sense when it's a photo of a person, but not when it's a photo of a house that was previously listed for sale but you can't remember where.  I think I misunderstood what this and similar apps are designed to do. It seems they just bring up similar images and similar image categories.

It has improved slowly over the years and has some unique features like defining a \Trusted peer\ (eg your own Bitcoin full node!). Unfortunately it still lacks a UI to backup BIP-39 seed or ability to handle Trezor + multiple HD accounts or fee controls. Communicating directly with the Bitcoin network is very cool, but it means users rely on bloom filters (which have serious privacy issues).

I don't like that it's in metric for the measurement of the food items. It should have a settings option to shift to standard measurements that we use in the US. I also find it somewhat annoying that I can only enter a single small piece of carrot at a time instead of selecting multiple pieces at once. If I sit eat a handful of baby carrot sticks I don't want to have to enter each one individually. It has the potential to be a great app.

For people who are not artists and who may not be familiar with other animation tools, this app isn't as intuitive as the dev may think it is, so a user guide or first-time-use walk through would be great.   Having layers and copy/paste, scale and rotate is awesome. I like the various brushes and color controls. It's been really stable and has great features.  Praise: Love the app. Thanks for not invading our privacy with permissions. Add a \support us\ link somewhere. I'd pay a couple of bucks for a \pro\ version.   Possible bug: To arrange layers at the top or bottom of the layer stack, I'm having to duplicate the layers in question, arrange them the way I want, ignoring the top (or bottom) layer, then delete the layer at the top or the bottom. It seems that \grabbing\ that top layer doesn't work. (Flaming Galaxy S7)  Feature Request: Ability to import existing gifs or short videos as a layer. Feature Request: Ability to size the canvas up to HD or even 4k.  Hey devs: msg me and I'd be happy to build HTML documentation for the app from notes or whatever you have.

I'm very happy about that. The keyboard is wonderful. The color changing feature is so natural that you'll occasionally forget it even happens. Excellent choice for people who loved the Google keyboard but value their privacy.

Disabling the back button isn't user friendly. The user doesn't need to know the technical details of session expiration. The updated permissions and new documents feature are signs that the app will improve. Loan holders will likely be engaged with this company for years, so the app should keep them engaged, acknowledge progress toward financial goals, provide useful tools and stay modern. Your website does this very well, now let your app follow the same model.

Native Call recorder as part of phone would be good. I wish a Chaton app with call video and the rest of the features it had, were available for Samsung users ,so apple/farcebook/wartsapp/cia factory fodder could be deleted from our Sammo phones. Call recorder apps are handy for insurance or Ebay type calls but with 3rd party apps you forget till its too late, optional Samsung downloads are the way to go.

Boo on you and it sends it to your contacts using a different number that's not even your phone number I'm contacting my lawyer about this as well good luck with that

NOT EVEN Close,  could not find anything suitable for kids to watch & the content is lacking & not current.  No real movies no real shows. Worse is the permissions requirement of the app & vzw sale of your habit information to Neilsons consumer ratings.

I've used MB on my computer for several years. It has been the ONLY one to find virus/Malware the other popular ones always failed. Very happy to see android version!  *scans at scheduled time   *scans downloading apps    * very light   *non-intrusive *doesn't use too much ram or slow you down. *limited permissions  *exactly the way a good Antivirus/anti malware should be.

Anyone who really thinks this is real there intelligence is in question. If a spirit spends the effort to communicate its not going to spit random words that hold absolutely no meaning.

So yes,  there no deception because they clearly state entertainment in description.

Why would an app need to make and manage phone calls from my phone?  I denied that permission then it wanted to make contact with all of my contacts. When I denied that permission it refused to let me open it up. Why would anyone allow an app to make and manage calls from your phone and give them a contact list? I just wanted to do the meditation. This is the reason for the low ranking.

But seriously, what is that? 1: it needs access to contacts and I have no idea why. Marshmallow permission system anyone? 2: it's one of those terribly not-native experiences. It's just a website. It looks similar to a typical android app but non of the gestures you're used to works. Functionality is OK though hence the 2nd star.

I can see a list of dogs but they're all on the other side of a river so they are not actually close at all. If there was a way to see dogs on the map, like \5 dogs hanging out at the Sunny Park Dog Run\ then you could see where is a good spot for your pup to meet other dogs. It could remain anonymous for privacy/safety etc. Something like the Uber map when you can see nearby cars?

This app allows a 'school or  government' to make changes to your phone: apps, personal files etc. Hard to uninstall. Follow instructions below on how to. Reviewer below says it's not 'Google's fault' - I feel however that one automatically and in good faith trusts Google if it's named 'Google'. Misplaced trust however. By installing this app you're effectively giving Google permission to grant a third party access to  enable changes to your phone. AVOID!

Probably more of an android issue than a true key issue. It will switch me to different keyboard if u want the app to auto fill in a user name and password. It won't switch me back to my original keyboard automatically. This whole process takes a minute or two.

Edit: all locations must be added in advance in the main app - that's cumbersome at least. The current time is 11:30, your app says 10:00? Does that mean weather data fetched only once per 2 hours? That's insane. Also, fix permissions. You don't need my contacts.

It only logs about have of the driving I do. I never should have listened to my agent to try this after I read all the reviews and did my research. It's not worth it all. But that's a risk you take when you use an app that asks for so many permissions. I should have just gone with my gut instinct and said no.

As soon as i log in there is a \invalid\ message at the home page stating \i do not have permission to view this page\. It's been 13 days and amazon customer service or tech department doesn't know what it means and they haven't been able to fix it yet. They confuse this app for the \Seller central\ app which makes it hard to get them to fix this app.

However, there are a few things I take issue with. One is the recent update which requires access to my calendar. I tweeted at Untappd asking for an explanation, but received no response. Until I hear a justifiable answer, I think calendar access is an unwarranted breach of privacy, at least for an app I use just for finding beers.   Also, there are some improvements I think should be made. For one, it's not very good at filtering out places on Foursquare where I'd likely be at while drinking beer. It should prioritize bars, restaurants, pubs, breweries, etc. when I check in. Also, I'd prefer to know the parent company of the beer, not just the label brewery - like AB Imbev for Goose Island beers for example.   I'll add a star once I hear a legit reason for the calendar access, and I'll add another star once the other issues get fixed.

It is easy to use and seems to be accurate.  The only thing I wish it had was a way to pull the data from from a cloud storage.  I upgraded phones and had to manually add my old data.  I recently located a \ share\ option,  this may have provided me with the info i was looking for, but if the older phone was inoperable I would have been stuck. I don't remember what permissions are needed for my app currently. I hate sharing info w/3rd party vendors.

The drivers can see rather or not you tip. Spoke to employees & they are not paid well in most areas outside of places like SF and will get offended if you don't tip. With that being said it's not free shipping and handling, or it is but you risk god knows what happening to your food before getting to you, or ect (risky). I'd rather tip after, or have some privacy about my tip but that has changed so I don't want to use this app anymore personally.

The GPS is absolutely horrible. Can never make the signal strong or decent it is always weak and that provides me running a mile in less then a minute \Which I wouldn't mind if someone could do that IN REAL LIFE\ I have absolutely made sure that my gps is enabled. The app has permission and still provides the worst signal. How am I suppose to know my lap pase when it is beyond irrational!!!

The effective resolution is comparable to an old CRT SD TV, even though we're viewing on devices w/ greater than 1080p. I think I'll have to resort to pirating the episodes to watch them properly, which is a shame b/c the show developers won't receive any revenue. // AND now the app update asks for microphone permissions w/o any explanation given?? I wanted to update just to to see if vid quality has improved, but I don't install spyware. Way to push customers away from you.

The shield scan is a very frustrating thing, it works great but there is a time delay to refill with a max of only 4 scan points, which is not so bad if not for the idea that rescans are required to level up your shield powers and each upgrade scan cost more scan points each time, it would be nice if you can scan them in and place them in a queue, digging out the Lego pieces every half a day is a little annoying  *on initial loading this thing did nothing, just stood at the load screen, it appears this app has not been updated for android MM (it should ask for permissions), go into the app drawer and manual allow access to camera and local storage and it will solve your problems

This is all in my own experience. This app should come pre-installed on all phones. All of these complaints are 95 percent human error/stupidity. The complaint about permissions is a simple fix, just turn them off. The app works great and I'd recommend it to everyone!

Also gives you the option to clear up room on your phone by deleting the photos it's saved.  My biggest issue is that they can freely contact everyone in your phone book and send them a message saying you recommend this app to them.  It's illegal to do this type of activity without my permission.  They ask vaguely for you permission to access you phone and Facebook which you have to say yes to in order to use the app but thats not permission...

Granted,   it needs to be able to write to USB IF you want to export data.   However,   there is no real reason why it needs to change WiFi state,   get call data etc.   Asking for all the permissions like they do is just because they know most people won't care.

I contacted the developer (response below). App requests 14 permissions, 7 are defined as \Dangerous\ by Google. Some unusual requests I noted include access to my precise location (similar apps only request general location), know the phone number of someone I called/called me, ability to call phone numbers, ability to use camera, and ability to turn on my flashlight. ***Generic response from Cub Customer Care: \The mobile app does require access to contacts, call logs and camera/flash.  By allowing access to the mobile phone features the customer can call a store, pharmacy, etc from the mobile app. The user can email their list directly from the app, instead of being pushed to a different app or browser.  This also allows the application to grab the user’s contact information and the email address they already have stored and to use this directly within the app. The camera request is to that the user can scan barcodes. Access to your location is to determine you distance to a store using store locator.\

For buying online you need my location, device ID an call info, photos and media files, wifi info? and the list goes on. Remove all unnecessary permissions. People get hacked by people like this, they get access to your info and do whatever they want with it, that's what a hacker does. They're not so smart after all.

You might ask yourself, why would a calculator have caller ID??? Tbh im just as confused as you are, but you'd be surprised to find that that exists. It's dumb I know. But this app isn't like that! It's actually good! You need a free calculator app? Get this one. Trust me.

Prompted by a screen that's wants acess to my contacts. Says no. Game crashes. Try to open game again keeps crashing. When a game won't let you play because they can't acess your contacts. The game shouldn't exist. Privacy is something that is disappearing with the progression of technology. I won't let some stupid game company look through my contacts just so I can play a \simulated stock market\ and be bombarded by ads. 10/10 would sell my privacy for a free game

And it asks to manage your calls. If you deny the app permission it won't let you use the app. I tried a search from Cancun to Havana. And the Cuban airport was not an option. This flight exists with Aeromexico, but  the app won't allow it. This app is worthless.

There is absolutely no reason this app needs to have permissions to all that it is demanding to be on my phone. You don't need to see my contact list or access my camera. You need my id and Wi-Fi. That's it. So, no. Not using your app anymore.

Why would I want people to know where and when I run? I've found it easy to keep them private with this app. The privacy settings are easy to find.  Also, I found one can export the data (gpx and more). To me, that's the make it, or break it of an app. So, well deserved 5 stars. Thank you, developers. But, please, concentrate development efforts on accuracy. Looks aren't more important than accuracy!  Anyway, love the app.

Why, then, would a company/app insist on a person's phone number? This app shows no option available unless you agree to an unknown amount of unwanted and intrusive text messages. This violation of privacy far, far outweighs any possible benefit to be derived should anyone agree to such terms. There are other, more viable applications available to serve this purpose minus the invasive tactics and perhaps with better end results. I will immediately delete and forget this one.

I recently reported a bug with the Privacy Adviser notifications resetting on me.  Bitdefender support investigated in a very timely fashion and then resolved in their latest update.  As a very unexpected bonus, they compensated me for my inconvenience which was unnecessary but extremely appreciated. The sign of a good product in my mind is one where the producer listens and works to address any problems reasonably and Bitdefender gets an A++ from me.

In Marshmallow (Android 6+) the app goes haywire because it isn't designed for the new permissions model.   You can go into Settings, Apps, GetMe and set them manually, but no one is going to know how to do that.  Also, the app's page in Google Play doesn't even mention Austin, something you might want to look into right now as Uber and Lyft are out and it's GetMe's time to shine.  Additional Note: Anonymous CEO of GetMe has potential ties back to Austin's city council.  Given what recently happened with Uber and Lyft....this would be very interesting if it's true.

I have to say, this is an excellent piece of software and, after some tweaking, hands down the most effective communication tool I have used. Good support too. Yes, there is a learning curve to get it setup properly and working happily with other programs on your average android phone. But that's well worth the end result!

You've always been a battery and GPU hog, that's OK when I'm using the app, but now you always run in the background. Even after forced stop, is this spyware? Now deleting, good luck.

Deny works to dismiss the dialog. No audio permission essentially makes the app unusable. Note: Figured out the work around on my own, the reply did take a while but I understand the delay. I am leaving my original comment for anyone else facing the problem. In the mean time updating the rating for overall satisfaction. Thank you

The first time I installed Spectrum TV was about 3+ months ago, immediately my phone kept freezing on me whether the app was running or not, so after many attempts (kept freezing) I finally got it uninstalled and my phone went back to its normal running.  A few days ago I decided to give it another try.  Installed it and this time the app triggered super su in asking for permission to install something.  I made the mistake of answering \allow\.   Again, my phone started to randomly freezing up whether the app was running or not.  After finally getting it uninstalled my phone still freezes randomly, what ever got installed when I \allowed\ the app to do what ever it did, did not get uninstalled/removed.  Now I'm having to try to completely factory reset my phone, not sure if this will work or not but that's what installing this has come to.  I'd be curious if anyone else with a rooted phone has experienced the same.  My question for Spectrum is what was installed that would require special permission on a rooted phone?

Polluted with ads, bulk extras, & too many extra permissions. Anyway, I've since began looking for a app to takes it place on my device/s. Solid Explorer is that app! Everything one needs in a file explorer & manager with none of the uselessness. Not a fan of trails, but I did purchase cause it was such a good app. Just hope it stays that way! 😉👍 PS, kudos on Goat Mode! 😂

From a user perspective reports are a pain.  Excel is easier, lots of sync issues, you can't submit two reports in a row quickly,  smart scan takes a ridiculous amount of time.  Also they try to gain permissions to read my contacts.

Can even lockdown system apps like calls, interwebs, notifications and even (thank God) the \App Info\ screen. Further, all the android permissions that the app asks for, they specifically state they will NOT collect or use your information. Also, no annoying popup ads or notifcations nor do they try to push you to download extra sh#*. Love it.

I checked in my permissions for the app (I'm running Marshmallow), and I found that SwagBucks could send and receive any text, view anything about my phone and even make calls on my behalf, edit anything on my SD card, control my system settings, such as vibrate, and even get my exact location (which is for surveys). I would not recommend even downloading this at all on your phone, as it uses the permissions right as it starts.

Fun Easy Learn has now decided that it needs access to your media files, device history, and device identity.  THINK ABOUT THIS PEOPLE - why on earth would a flashcard application need to see what you've been doing on the internet?  What possible good could come from giving random strangers access to all your personal photographs and texted pictures stored on your device??!     When the app was first on the market, it didn't require any special permissions, but just recently these privacy invasions slowly started creeping in. They are completely out of touch with reality.   A lot of us paying customers are uninstalling it or refusing to upgrade.  Also, I don't know if it's true about all of the languages, but there are a decent number of mistakes in the language I used.  They are supposed to be the experts - not us!  Would you buy a college math book that got answers wrong 5% of the time?  I tried reporting some of the inaccuracies, but half a year later the same old mistakes are still there.  To be fair, I have downloaded other apps that had even more mistakes, so it could be worse in that respect.

The interface is beautiful and functional, the syncing is seamless and the diary writing experience is phenomenal whether on the Web, chrome app or mobile. Also, for privacy enthusiasts,  the data is stored on your own Google Drive, so accessing it is not easy for the developers or any third party. All in all, great app and a definite recommend from my side for anyone looking for an app to write diary entries.

But when that permission is granted to enerybar it  prevents changing or granting other apps their required permissions. So any time a new app is installed requiring say permission to access internal storage, you have to turn off energybar and disable it's permission to show over other apps. A royal pain in the butt to remember to do everytime, not to mention time consuming.

Since it being installed without my consent or knowledge my phone has been acting up. It infringes on our ability to decide what we want vs. What we need. There is a reason there are options packets for private and business. How in the world did this get the okay to mass install on everyone's phones? This infringes on basic rights to choose. I realize loss of customers is no threat because the service is the best, but come on was this necessary?

There is usually obvious sides taken in issues without even considering the initial situation.

The Disqus integration for comments works nicely as well. The app notifications that still come in even when you turn them off in the settings are annoying though, please fix that.

Edit: The dev has responded saying that accessibility access is necessary, however it really isn't. A draw over other apps permission probably wouldve worked, while accessibility provides access to so much, like reading text on the screen at anytime.

And the best part is I am an Optimum customer so you have all of my information already. MSNBC doesn't ask for any of these permissions. Very disappointed and I will be uninstalling.

Why does it need high precise GPS (which is a battery killer), when you can only have one favorite store, in some ways it's far simpler to use paper ver.  Also want control over when it runs, I don't shop everyday, would rather turn it on/off on my schedule, rather than have it constantly track me (big difference between free &paying to give up your privacy), liked the paper edition, but the app has soured me on Chinook book.

Beautiful looking and well behaved app.  No account to create and worry about privacy concerns!  I don't see a way to store/export/import my watch list.  I recently did a factory reset on my phone and lost this data.  Having this would make it even better.  Thank you!

If an app needs access to photos,  contacts, or messaging then its not worth downloading.  If permissions are denied then app can't be used until fixed which is dumb in its self.

Reinstalled numerous times, no success.  Doesn't show batter level etc. LG G4. I have also manually given the app all permissions.      ***Update : App is good, took uninstalling and reinstalling a dozen times to get to sync. Don't know if it was the reason but when I finally got it going I had the Android Wear app and the Zenwatch app freshly installed and running and all permissions granted before restoring watch.

Android will already notify you of open wifi, so there's not really much benefit to the app other than perhaps automatically connecting to the ones it knows about. The app also wants permissions to control phone calls and read contacts.. no thanks.  I'll use my Time Warner Cable hotspot app.  At least they're proprietary hotspots and not just public wifi locations.

Thinking of deleting app since it's no longer easier.

Thank you for the quick response and explanations, I appreciate it and have changed my tune. :)

I keep my microphone blocked by special app at all times so I can't enjoy all the great features. I trust Microsoft not to abuse this permission more than others however.  Your device itself even without this app is a potential security risk, but this app is very handy and efficient.  It unfortunately can't be moved to the SD card without root.  It's not to big an app though.

Minimal permissions, no internet permission, no ads are big pluses. Other great features are drag & drop to order items in checklists, and putting shortcuts on the home screen. Auto-export / import, and auto-backup are useful, but both have issues, and are irritating to the point of being useless for local syncing.▪Auto-export / import does not transfer priority, it does transfer whether a checklist item is checked off, but after import does not strikethrough checked items even when this option is set in Settings. ▪When doing a Restore, you are not given a) an option of where to restore from, and b) can only choose the file to restore by its datetime (not filename). This makes it all but impossible to use backup files to sync locally, as all the backup datetimes end up the same, and therefore there is no way to tell which file is the one you want. WISHLIST▶▪What would eliminate these issues would be an option to keep notes & checklists on the internal SD (preferably in encrypted form), so they could be synced locally between devices (eg with Syncthing).

I'm guessing this is the price of some limited privacy in our world.  That said, i found nordvpn to have the best interface enabling rapid switch to an alternative server, and more consistent speed test wins. Also a reasonable price and responsive support. Early days but happy so far. Nice job nord.

Any screen saver should allow choice whether active or past notifications show contact info. When it connects my last call shows on the screen and I won't take a chance with texts because all my contact info or actual content may not be info I want to share with passengers. Finally, if  I  give voice address to and from, why do I have to still turn on location services?

It's fast, gives two options for market updates,  doesn't require any permissions, the ads are unobtrusive, and it has a low one time fee to purchase - not a subscription. One criticism, once you've entered a stock, you can't really edit it. I'll purchase after using it for a week.

What gives?  I am giving an extra star just for the middle finger emoji! I'd seriously like to support an app that respects what little privacy I have, lets me control my OWN settings, and control who views my posts! Need more time to test if this app really does that. Also need to get more FB friends to check it out too. We'll see! So far it's ok. It's free for basic use. You can pay for upgrades in icons, etc. If charging a small amount for extras keeps the advertisers out... NO PROBLEM. If I see ONE AD... I'm OUT.

I understand how permissions work, but if you have a new update with new permissions requested, at least put in either a reason for the new permission or otherwise describe the new feature that would constitute needing access to my phone media and files. Otherwise I'm not updating. May uninstall.

That's fine. But the fact that they *force* you to approve these permissions in order to use their app is highly discouraging, and I will not be using the app because of it. And if the other comments are any indication, I'm not alone. Time to take a look in the mirror, PNC, and fix your app.

Why doesnt the app simply ask for this permission when datk mode is enabled? That seems like a fairly simple workaround seeing as this app is useless for a lot of android users otherwise. At least post this workaround on the help page of your website so people can find it.

Why do I need to draw the patter every time when I just try to read the incoming notifications and not actually opening it. Please help me in this issue. That is annoying. If the problem is persistent I might have to uninstall it. Otherwise it's a great app.

I arranged an appt in the AM then I receive notification 10 min prior to the expected time of arrival that it was cancelled and rescheduled another day w/o my permission. If anyone can point otherwise they only method of contact is email which i find impersonal especially if you cancel last minute. First time and the last time!

At this time I can't rate the app higher because I believe it has some fundamental privacy issues that need to be addressed.  Even when they are, there are going to have to be some necessary trade-offs between utility and privacy, and I believe the app should caution users about this on first run.

If I can use the app, the scanner at exit isn't working or they forgot to get it and I have to wait until the manager brings it. Overall experience 2 stars. When it all works, 4 stars.    Original review: It took some permission adjustments and logging off and on a few times but I finally got it working and it is great! I hope the exit people get better trained since mine was confused. The app needs to be upgraded to automatically email a receipt like all other POS apps.

However, in the initial set up process, the app required that I disable screen overlay permission - on a completely separate app (Twilight). This is a bad programming practice. One app's performance should not impact the permissions or usability of another especially in the Android environment. Fix this or create a workaround and I would give it 5 stars.

I tried it as a driver, and I'm disappointed. Everything seems to be built for riders convenience, and it is very unconvenient for drivers, while driver is the one who provides the service! Most disappointing: - Absolutely no control over assigned route, no preferences at all. I can't specify how many riders are acceptable, what is acceptable detour distance. - No choice which route I like and which not. You are forced to drive whatever route is assigned to you. As a result, I'm not using carpool lane, large detours, sometimes it doubles my commute time. I'd like to drive every day, but in fact I can schedule a ride only if I have extra 30min of time. - Wrong pick up time. When I schedule to drive from 8:30am, this is the time I'm ready to start, and not the time I have already to pick up the rider! Why should I leave 15min earlier? For rider's convenience? What about me? - Privacy: my phone number is shared, I don't like that. - I must give positive or negative rating to the rider. What about neutral? - you don't really make any money here. $3 for a ride, if I cash it to bank account, after taxes it will be just $2, and most probably there is a transaction fee as well. It even doesn't cover gas expenses for detours. It makes sense only to drive in exchange of riding later.  In general system tries to maximize matches (satisfy riders and make profit for the company) and doesn't care about drivers convenience. That's sad :(

Even w/ months of daily use it took forever to earn a $5 gift card & by then it hardly seemed worth it.. but Adme cashes out via PayPal at $10 & I hit $1.61 the 1st day! And best of all in my book, their transparency about permissions definitely deserves 5 ☆'s =) Use invite code Ico47JtP1e {1st letter uppercase i} for a sign up bonus!

Issues I saw complaints for that look to be addressed:  * I could login without registering with root password of router * App did not ask for permissions. * Allows managing parental controls.   I just tried it now as I'm home and wanted to change the wifi power off schedule.  I don't see that it can do this at this time.   But it looks handy enough to keep around.     So far so good(used it for less than 5 minutes).  Let's see if my feature gets added too.  I like that I can see and manage parental controls from the app.

There is no reason for this. The explanation provided has nothing to do with why they want permission to access my contacts and make phone calls. Because it can't work without me agreeing to this i was forced to immediately uninstall the app.

The app linked to a stranger's FB acct, and there's no option to unlink that FB account so that I can link my actual FB account. Ridiculous, not to mention a clear violation of privacy since now if this other lady (the stranger) decides to sign up for G&C through FB, she'll be accessing MY actual G&C account. Furthermore, the app never synced up (despite being connected) with my LinkedIn.

It's not overloaded with fluff, it's easy to read, it's easy setup, it doesn't ask for unnecessary permissions (why do so many other apps want access to my contact list?  No this one.), no ads, etc.  Yes, there are other weather apps out there that serve some niche need that this app does not, but this one should be installed and evaluated before trying other apps.

So why do you need all the permissions for this app. It's wonderful to have the big book in an app, when AA world service had taken many of them down. But you don't need any of those permissions for this app. So I am not going to use it. Besides all the misspellings and errors. Sorry!

And don't even waste your time with the bull sh*t canned response of how to disable it. Anything on your phone, disabled or not, opens a potential back door for attackers to enter your phone. We didn't even agree to any permissions. If your product was a good product, that you actually stood behind and had faith in you, wouldn't have to force it to millions of people. Terrible app from an even worse company.

Also Amazon has shown their consideration for privacy by integrating an illuminated 'microphone mute button' T.D.C. of the unit (That's Top Dead Center of my Talking Dynamic Cylinder) (:-)

This is a lot better than the original version of the app. Is the location permission request to enforce broadcast blackout laws? Sure hope not...

Thank you for the explanation of the permissions. I wish you could find another technique. That said, I understand the Android framework has its foibles. Let's see how this goes.

I like how f.lux directly changes the driver color instead of adding an overlay, which means it doesn't interfere with apps asking for permissions, or screenshots. A new feature I'd like to see is to lower your brightness under what your display can normally do. A minor bug I have is whenever I disable or enable f.lux, I get a black screen. My fix for it is to turn off my screen, and turn it back on.

I don't need this crap! Just another unwelcome app I don't want! Plus, it uses too much storage. I'm considering switching to Apple. I'm tired of having apps installed on my phone without permission!

The app does not ask for permission to use the mike when installed. I had to go into apps, choose Voice Training and grant the app access to my microphone. Everything works now. Very happy.

Just so you can play this game. Don't think so. Totally ridiculous

Perfectly streamlined, and minimal permissions! Props to the dev team!
